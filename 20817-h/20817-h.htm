<h2>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p>For many years the call for a book on the mother and her
child has come to us from patients, from the public, and
now from our publishers&mdash;and this volume represents our
efforts to supply this demand.</p>

<p>The larger part of the work was originally written by Dr. Lena
K. Sadler, with certain chapters by Dr. William S. Sadler, but
in the revision and re-arrangement of the manuscript so much
work was done by each on the contributions of the other, that
it was deemed best to bring the book out under joint authorship.</p>

<p>The book is divided into three principal parts: <a href="#PART_I">Part <span class="smcap">I</span></a>, dealing
with the experience of pregnancy from the beginning of
expectancy to the convalescence of labor: <a href="#PART_II">Part <span class="smcap">II</span></a>, dealing with
the infant from its first day of life up to the weaning time; <a href="#PART_III">Part
<span class="smcap">III</span></a>, taking up the problems of the nursery from the weaning to
the important period of adolescence.</p>

<p>The advice given in this work is that which we have tried
out by experience&mdash;both as parents and physicians&mdash;and we
pass it on to mothers, fathers, and nurses with the belief
that it will be of help in their efforts at practical and scientific
"child culture." We believe, also, that the expectant mother
will be aided and encouraged in bearing the burdens which are
common to motherhood by the advice and instruction offered.</p>

<p>While we have drawn from our own professional and personal
experience in the preparation of this book, we have also
drawn freely from the present-day literature dealing with the
subjects treated, and desire to acknowledge our indebtedness
to the various writers and authorities.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">[Pg viii]</a></span></p>

<p>We now jointly send forth the volume on its mission, as a
contribution toward lightening the task and inspiring the efforts
of those mothers, nurses, and others who honor us by a perusal
of its pages.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>
<h2>THE EXPECTANT MOTHER</h2>
</div>

<p>There can be no grander, more noble, or higher calling
for a healthy, sound-minded woman than to become the
mother of children. She may be the colaborer of the business
man, the overworked housewife of the tiller of the soil, the
colleague of the professional man, or the wife of the leisure
man of wealth; nevertheless, in every normal woman in every
station of life there lurks the conscious or sub-conscious maternal
instinct. Sooner or later the mother-soul yearns and
cries out for the touch of baby fingers, and for that maternal
joy that comes to a woman when she clasps to her breast the
precious form of her own babe.</p>

<h4>MOTHERHOOD THE HIGHEST CALLING</h4>

<p>Motherhood is by far woman's highest and noblest profession.
Science, art, and careers dwindle into insignificance when we
attempt to compare them with motherhood. And to attain
this high profession, to reach this manifest "goal of destiny,"
women are seeking everywhere to obtain the best information,
and the highest instruction regarding "mothercraft," "babyhood,"
and "child culture."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span></p>

<p>In an Indiana town not long ago, at the close of a lecture,
a small, intellectual-appearing mother came forward, and, tenderly
placing her tiny and emaciated infant in my arms, said:
"O Doctor! can you help me feed my helpless babe? I'm
sure it is going to die. Nothing seems to help it. My father
is the banker in this town. I graduated from high school and
he sent me to Ann Arbor, and there I toiled untiringly for four
years and obtained my degree of B. A. I have gone as far as
I could&mdash;spent thousands of dollars of my unselfish father's
money&mdash;but I find myself totally ignorant of my own child's
necessities. I cannot even provide her food. O Doctor! can't
something be done for young women to prepar&eacute; them for
motherhood?"</p>

<h4>MOTHERCRAFT PREPARATION</h4>

<p>The time will come when our high and normal schools will
provide adequate courses for the preparation of the young
woman for her highest profession, motherhood. This young
mother, who had reached the goal of Bachelor of Arts, found
to her sorrow that she was entirely deficient in her education
and training regarding the duties and responsibilities of a
mother. In every school of the higher branches of education
that train young women in their late teens there should be a
chair of mothercraft, providing practical lectures on baby
hygiene, dress, bathing, and the general care of infants, and
giving instruction in the rudiments of simple bottle-feeding,
together with the caloric values of milk, gruels, and other
ingredients which enter into the preparation of a baby's food.</p>

<p>Young women would most enthusiastically enroll for such
classes, and as years passed and marriage came and children
to the home, imagine the gratitude that would flood the souls
of the young mothers who were fortunate enough to have
attended schools where the chairs of motherhood prepared
them for these new duties and responsibilities.</p>

<h4>EARLY MEDICAL SUPERVISION</h4>

<p>Just as soon as it is known that a baby is coming into the
home, the expectant mother should engage the best doctor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
she can afford. She should make frequent calls at his office
and intelligently carry out the instruction concerning water
drinking, exercise, diet, etc. Twenty-four hour specimens of
urine should be frequently saved and taken to the physician
for examination. In these days the blood-pressure is closely
observed, together with approaching headaches and other evidences
of possible kidney complications. The early recognition
of these dangers is accompanied by the immediate employment
of appropriate sweating procedures and other measures designed
to promote the elimination of body poisons. Thus science is
able effectively to stay the progress of the high blood-pressure
of former days, and which was so often followed by eclampsia&mdash;uremic
poisoning.</p>

<p>In these days of careful urine analysis, expertly administered
anaesthetics, and up-to-date hospital confinements, the average
intelligent woman may enter into pregnancy quite free from
the oldtime fears, whose only rewards were grief and cankering
care. All fear of childbirth and all dread of maternal duties
and sacrifices do not in the least lessen the necessary unpleasantness
associated with normal labor. It lies in the choice of
every expectant mother to journey through the months of
pregnancy with dissatisfaction and resentment or with joy
and serenity. "The child will be born and laid in your arms
to be fed, cared for, and reared, whether you weep or smile
through the months of waiting."</p>

<h4>THE RESENTFUL MOTHER</h4>

<p>A little woman came into our office the day of this writing,
saying: "Doctor, I'm just as mad as I can be; I don't want to
be pregnant, I just hate the idea." As I smiled upon this
girl-wife of nineteen, I drew from my desk a sheet of paper
and slowly wrote down these words for the head of a column:
"Got a mad on," and for the head of another, "Got a glad on;"
and then we quickly set to work carefully to tabulate all the
results that having a "mad on" would bring. We found to
her dismay that its harvest would be sadness of the heart,
husband unhappy, work unbearable, while all church duties
as well as social functions would be sadly marred. Then, just<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
as carefully, we tabulated the benefits that would follow having
a "glad on." Her face broke into a smile; she laughed, and as
she left the office she assured me that she would accept Nature's
decree, make the best of her lot, and thus wisely align
herself with the normal life demands of old Mother Nature.
This view of her experience, she came to see, would bring the
greatest amount of happiness to both herself and husband.
She left me, declaring that she was just "wild for a baby;"
and there is still echoing in my ears her parting words: "I'm
leaving you, Oh, such a happy girl! and I'm going home to
Harold a happy and contented expectant mother."</p>

<p>There often enters on the exit of a discontented and resentful
expectant mother, a woman, very much alone in the world&mdash;perhaps
a bachelor maid or a barren wife, who, as she sits
in the office, bitterly weeps and wails over her state of loneliness
or sterility; and so we are led to realize that discontentment
is the lot of many women; and we are sometimes led to regret
that ours is not the power to take from her that hath and give
to her that hath not.</p>

<h4>EARLY SIGNS OF PREGNANCY</h4>

<p>Among the first questions an expectant mother asks is:
"What are early signs of pregnancy?" The answer briefly is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Cessation of menstruation.</li>
<li>Changes in the breast.</li>
<li>Morning sickness.</li>
<li>Disturbances in urination.</li>
</ol>

<p>Menstruation may be interrupted by other causes than pregnancy,
but the missing of the second or third periods usually
indicates pregnancy. Accompanying the cessation of menstruation,
changes in the breast occur. Sensation in the breasts
akin to those which usually accompany menstruation are manifested
at this time in connection with the unusual sensations
of stinging, prickling, etc. Fully one-half of our patients do
not suffer with "morning sickness;" however, it is the general
consensus of opinion that "morning sickness" is one of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
early signs of pregnancy, and these attacks consist of all
gradations&mdash;from slight dizziness to the most severe vomiting.
It is an unpleasant experience, but in passing through it we
may be glad in the thought that "it too, will pass."</p>

<p>Because of the pressure exerted by the growing uterus upon
the bladder, disturbances in urination often appear, but as the
uterus continues to grow and lifts itself up and away from the
bladder these symptoms disappear.</p>

<p>Chief of the later signs of pregnancy are "quickening" or
fetal movements. The movements are very much like the
"fluttering of a young birdling." They usually are felt by the
expectant mother between the seventeenth and eighteenth
weeks. This sign, together with the noting of the fetal heartbeat
at the seventh month, constitute the positive signs of
pregnancy.</p>

<h4>PROBABLE DATE OF DELIVERY</h4>

<p>And now our expectant mother desires to know when to
expect the little stranger. From countless observations of
childbirth under all conditions and in many countries, the pregnant
period is found to cover about thirty-nine weeks, or two
hundred and seventy-three days. There are a number of ways
or methods of computing this time. Many physicians count
back three months and add seven days to the first day of the
last menstruation. For instance, if the last menstruation were
December 2 to 6, then, to find the probable day of delivery, we
count back three months to September 2, and then add seven
days. This gives us September 9, as the probable date of
delivery. The real date of delivery may come any time within
the week of which this calculated date is the center.</p>

<p>As a rule, ten days to two weeks preceding the day of delivery,
the uterus "settles" down into the pelvis, the waist line becomes
more comfortable, and the breathing is much easier.</p>

<p>On the accompanying page, may be found a table for computing
the probable day of labor, prepared in accordance with
the plan just described.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER II</h2>
<h2>STORY OF THE UNBORN CHILD</h2>
</div>

<p>To every physician in every community, sooner or later in
his experience there come thoughtless women making
requests that we even hesitate to write about. Their excuses
for the crime which they seek to have the physician join them
in committing, range all the way from "I don't want to go
to the trouble," to "Doctor, I've got seven children now, and
I can't even educate and dress them properly;" or, maybe, "I
nearly lost my life with the last one."</p>

<h4>EMBRYOLOGICAL IGNORANCE</h4>

<p>One little woman came to us the other day from the suburbs,
and honestly, frankly, related this story:</p>

<p>"We've been married just six months, I have continued my
stenographic work to add the sixty-five dollars to our monthly
income. Doctor, we must meet our monthly payments on the
home, I must continue to work, or we shall utterly fail. I am
perfectly willing a baby shall come to us two years from now,
but, doctor, I just can't allow this one to go on, you must help
me just this once. Why doctor, there can't be much form or
life there, it's only three months now, or will be next week, and
you know it's nothing but a mass of jelly."</p>

<p>She had talked with a "confidential friend" in her neighborhood,
had been told that she "could do it herself," but fearing
trouble or infection, had come to the conclusion she had better
go to a "clean, reputable physician," to have the abortion
performed.</p>

<p>This is not the place to narrate the experiences of the unfortunate
victims of habitual criminal abortion, but we would like
to impress upon the reader some realization of the untimely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
deaths, the awful suffering, and the life-long remorse and
sorrow of the poor, misguided women who listen to the criminal
advice of neighborhood "busybodies." The infections, the
invalidism, the sterility that so often follow in the wake of
these practices, are well known to all medical people.</p>

<h4>THE STREAM OF LIFE</h4>

<p>And so after the patient's last statement, "It's nothing but
a mass of jelly," we began the simple but wonderfully beautiful
story of the development of the "child enmothered." Just as
all vegetables, fruits, nuts, flowers, and grains come from seeds
sown into fertile soil, and just as these seeds receive nourishment
from the soil, rain, and sunshine, so all our world of
brothers and sisters, of fathers and mothers, came from tiny
human seeds, and in their turn received nourishment from the
peculiarly adapted stream of life, which flows in the maternal
veins for the nourishment and upbuilding of the unborn embryo.</p>

<p>Every little girl and boy baby that comes into the world, has
stored within its body, in a wonderfully organized capsule, a
part of the ancestral stream of life that unceasingly has
flowed down through the centuries from father to son and
from mother to daughter. This "germ plasm" is a divine gift
to be held in trust and carefully guarded from the odium of
taint, to be handed down to the sons and daughters of the
next generation. Any young man who grasps the thought that
he possesses a portion of the stream of life, that he holds it
in sacred trust for posterity, cannot fail to be impressed with
a sense of solemn responsibility so to order his life as to be
able to transmit this biologic trust to succeeding generations
free from taint and disease.</p>

<h4>THE PROCESS OF FERTILIZATION</h4>

<p>Just as within the body of "Mother Morning Glory" (See
<a href="#illus-018">Fig. <ins class="typo" title="Transcriber's note: original reads '15'">18</ins></a>) may be found the ovary or seed bed, so there are two
wonderfully organized bodies about the size of large almonds
found in the lower part of the female abdomen on either side of
the uterus, and connected to it by two sensitive tubes. There
ripens in one of these bodies each month a human baby-seed,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
which finds its way to the uterus through the little fallopian tube
and is apparently lost in the debris of cells and mucus which, with
the accompanying hemorrhage go to make up the menstrual flow.
This continues from puberty to menopause, each gland alternatingly
ripening its ovum, only to lose it in the periodical
phenomenon of menstruation, which is seldom interrupted save
by that still more wonderful phenomenon of conception.</p>

<p>At the time of conception, countless numbers of male germ-cells
(sperms) are lost&mdash;only one out of the multitude of these
perfectly formed sperms made up of the mosaics of hereditary
depressors, determiners, and suppressors that so subtly
dictate and determine the characteristics and qualifications of
the on-coming individual&mdash;I repeat, only one of these wonderful
sperms finds the waiting ovum (<a href="#illus-003">Fig. 1</a>). In this search
for the ovum, the sperm propels itself forward by means of its
tail&mdash;for the male sperm in general appearance very much
resembles the little pollywog of the rain barrel (<a href="#illus-003">Fig. 1</a>).</p>

<p>The fateful meeting of the sperm and the ovum takes place
usually in the upper end of one of the fallopian tubes. It is
a wonderful occasion. The wide-awake, vibrating lifelike
sperm plunges head first and bodily into the ovum. The tail,
which has propelled this bundle of life through the many wanderings
of its long and perilous journey, now no longer needed,
drops off and is lost and forgotten. This union of the male
and female sex cells is called "fertilization." There immediately
follows the most complete blending of the two germ cells&mdash;one
from the father and one from the mother&mdash;each with
its peculiar individual, family, racial, and national characteristics.
Here the combined determiners determine the color of
the eyes, the characteristics of the hair, the texture of the
skin, its color, the size of the body, the stability of the nervous
system, the size of the brain, etc., while the suppressors do a
similar work in the modification of this or that family or racial
characteristic.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 1. Steps in Early Development.</span>
</div>

<h4>THE FIRST WEEKS OF LIFE</h4>

<p>The fertilized ovum remains in the tube for about one week,
when it slowly makes its way down into the uterus, all the
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>while rapidly undergoing segmentation or division. It does not
grow much in size during this first week, but divides and
subdivides first, into two parts, then four, then eight, then
sixteen and so on, until we have a peculiar little body made
up of many equally divided parts, and known as the "Mulberry
Mass" (<a href="#illus-003">Fig. 1</a>). The blending of the sperm and ovum
has been perfect, the division of the original body multitudinous.</p>

<p>While this division of the united sex cells is progressing,
a wonderful change is also taking place in the inside lining
of the uterus. Instead of the usual thin lining, it has greatly
thickened and has become highly sensitized, and as the ovum
enters the uterus from the fallopian tube, this sensitized lining
catches it and holds it in its folds&mdash;actually covers it with
itself&mdash;holding the precious mass much as the cocoon, you have
so often seen fastened to the side of a plant or leaf, holds its
treasure of life.</p>

<p>Just as soon as the new uterine home is found the baby
heart begins to make its appearance, as also do many other
rudimentary parts. By the end of the third week, our round
mass has flattened and curved and elongated, and the nervous
system and brain begin to develop, while the primitive ears
begin to appear. At this time, the alimentary canal presents
itself as one straight tube which is a trifle larger at the head
end. And it is interesting to note that at this early date, even
the arms and legs are beginning to bud and push out from the
body.</p>

<h4>LATER EMBRYONIC DEVELOPMENT</h4>

<p>In the fourth and fifth weeks, the lungs and the pancreas
may be found, the heart develops, the nervous system has taken
on more definite form, and several of the larger blood-vessels
are appearing.</p>

<p>By the eighth week, by the most wonderful and complicated
processes of overlapping, pushing out, indentation, enfolding,
budding, pressing, and curving, the majority of the important
structures are formed&mdash;the eyes, ears, nose, hands, feet, abdominal
organs, and numerous glands. Thus, at the end of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
two months, almost every structure and organ necessary to
life is present in a rudimentary state.</p>

<h4>AT THE END OF THREE MONTHS</h4>

<p>By the close of the third month, witness the work of creation!
From the blending of the two germ cells there has come forth
a beautifully formed body (<a href="#illus-003">Fig. 1</a>). True, it is but three and
one half inches in length, but it is nevertheless a perfect body.
About this time, the sex may be determined. The eyes, nose,
ears, chin, arms and legs and even the fingers and toes may all
be clearly distinguished.</p>

<p>A "jelly mass" at three months? No, by no means! No!
Life and form and features are all there. It really has a
face, whose features may easily be delineated.</p>

<p>In all my experience, I have yet to find the woman who
wished to continue in her wicked and criminal intent after she
had listened to this story of the creative development of the
first three months of her "child enmothered."</p>

<p>During the next four months, which take us to the close of
the seventh, rapid growth and farther development take place
to the extent, that, should birth occur at that time, life may
continue under proper conditions.</p>

<h4>LAST WEEKS OF PREGNANCY</h4>

<p>Everything is now nearing completion&mdash;only awaiting further
growth, development, and strength&mdash;except some of the
bone development, which takes place during the remaining two
months. Growth is rapid, strength is doubled, and as the two
hundred and seventy-three days draw to a close, everything
has been completed. It has all taken place according to the
laws of creation in an infinite way and with clock-like precision.</p>

<p>With the developmental growth of the product of conception,
the uterus or room that had been particularly prepared for the
"big reception" of the second week, has also grown to great
dimensions. It fills almost the entire abdomen and as a result
of the pressure against the diaphragm the breathing is somewhat
embarrassed.</p>

<p>The door of this "room" has been closed by a special<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
mechanism, while, in the fullness of time, Mother Nature begins
the delicate work of opening the door, through whose portals
passes out into the world the completed babe.</p>

<p>The authors feel that this discussion of, and protest against,
abortions, <i>should be</i> accompanied by an appropriate consideration
of the control of pregnancy. We are never going to
eliminate the abortion curse of present-day civilization by merely
preaching against it&mdash;warnings and denouncements alone will
not suffice to remove the stain. Notwithstanding our feelings
and convictions in this respect, we are also well aware of the
fact that public sentiment is not now sufficiently ripe to welcome
such a full and frank discussion of the subject of the
prevention of conception as the authors would feel called upon
to present; we are equally cognizant of the fact that existing
postal regulations and other Federal laws are of such a character
(at least capable of such interpretation) as possibly to
render even the scientific and dignified consideration of such
subjects entirely out of question.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III</h2>
<h2>BIRTHMARKS AND PRENATAL INFLUENCE</h2>
</div>

<p>In the preceding chapter we learned that when the two
germ cells came together, there occurred a complete blending
of two separate and distinct hereditary lines, reaching from
the present away back into the dim and distant past. By the
union of these two ancestral strains a new personality is
formed, a new individual is created, with its own peculiar
characteristics.</p>

<h4>HEREDITARY TRAITS</h4>

<p>Probably none of the laboriously acquired accomplishments
of the present generation can be directly&mdash;and as such&mdash;handed
down to our children. What we are to be and what
we will do in this world was largely determined by the laws
of heredity by the time we were well started on our development
experience <i>en-utero</i> during the third or fourth week of
our prenatal existence, as outlined in a former chapter.</p>

<p>It is now generally accepted in scientific circles that acquired
characteristics are not transmissible. Someone has aptly stated
this truth by saying that "wooden heads are inherited, but
wooden legs are not." This does not by any means imply that
we do not have power and ability to fashion our careers and
carve out our own destiny, within the possible bounds of our
hereditary endowment and environmental surroundings. Heredity
does determine our "capital stock," but our own efforts
and acts determine the interest and increase which we may
derive from our natural endowment. From the moment conception
takes place&mdash;the very instant when the two sex cells meet
and blend&mdash;then and there "the gates of heredity are forever
closed." From that time on we are dealing with the problems<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
of nutrition, development, education, and environment; therefore,
so-called prenatal influence can have nothing whatever
to do with heredity.</p>

<p>A father may have acquired great talent as a physician or
a surgeon, in fact he may hold the chair of surgery in a medical
college, but each of his children come into the world without
the slightest knowledge of the subject, and, as far as direct and
immediate heredity is concerned, will have to work just about
as hard to master the subject as will the same average class of
children whose parents were not surgeons. This must not be
taken to mean that certain abilities and tendencies are not
inheritable&mdash;for they are; but they are inherited <i>through</i>
the parents&mdash;and not <i>from</i> them&mdash;directly. These transmitted
characteristics are largely "stock" traits, and usually have long
been present in the "ancestral strain."</p>

<h4>MATERNAL IMPRESSIONS</h4>

<p>A mother may sing and pray all through the nine months
of expectancy, or she may weep and scold, or even curse. In
neither case can she influence the spiritual or moral tendencies
of her child and cause it, through supposed prenatal influence,
to be born with criminal tendencies or to grow up a pious
lad or become a devout minister. These tendencies and characteristics
are all largely determined by the "depressors,"
"suppressors," and "determiners" which were present in the
two microscopic and mosaic germ cells which united to start
the embryo at the time of conception.</p>

<p>The child is destined to be born, endowed, and equipped with
the mental, nervous, and physical powers which his line has
fallen heir to all through the past ages. Down through the
ages education, religion, environment, and other special influences
have no doubt played a small part in influencing and
determining hereditary characteristics; just as environment in
the ages past changed the foot of the evolving horse from
a flat, "cushiony" foot with many toes (much needed in the
soft bog of his earlier existence) into the "hoof foot" of
later days, when harder soil and necessity for greater fleetness,
assisted by some sort of "selection" and "survival," con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>spired
to give us the foot of our modern horse, and this story
is all plainly and serially told in the fossil and other remains
found in our own hemisphere. It would appear that many, many
generations of education and environment are required to influence
markedly the established and settled train of heredity
regarding any particular element or characteristic in any particular
line or lines of hereditary tendencies.</p>

<h4>EUGENIC SUPERSTITION</h4>

<p>There is probably more misinformation in the minds of the
people on the subject of "maternal impressions" and "birthmarks"
than any other scientific or medical subject. The
popular belief that, if a pregnant woman should see an ugly
sight or pass through some terrifying experience, in some
mysterious way her unborn child would be "marked," deformed,
or in some way show some blemish at birth, is a time-honored
and ancient belief.</p>

<p>Such unscientific and unwarranted teaching has been handed
down from mother to daughter through the ages, while the
poor, misguided souls of expectant women have suffered untold
remorse, heaped blame upon themselves, lived lives literally
cursed with fear and dread&mdash;veritable slaves to superstition
and bondage&mdash;all because of the simple fact that a certain percentage
of all children born in this world have sustained some
sort of an injury or "embryological accident" during the first
days of fetal existence. For instance, take the common birthmark
of a patch of reddened skin on the face, brow, or neck.
As soon as the baby is born, the worried mother asks in
anxious tones: "Doctor, is it all right, is it perfect, has it
got any birthmarks?" On being told that the baby has a
round, red patch on its left brow, the ever-ready statement
of the mother comes forth: "Yes, I knew I'd mark it, I was
picking berries one day about three months ago, and I ate and
ate, until I suddenly remembered I might mark my baby, and
before I knew what I was doing, I touched my brow and I
just knew I had marked my baby." Do you know, reader, that
that birthmark was present fully four months before she passed
through that experience in the berry patch? And yet so worried<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
and apprehensive has been the pregnant mother, that, although
she can never successfully predict the "birthmarks" and blemishes
of her child, nevertheless when these defects are disclosed
at birth she is unfailingly able immediately to recall some
extraordinary experience which she has carefully stored away
in her memory and which, to her mind, most fully explains
and accounts for the defect.</p>

<p>Is it much wonder that in the very early days of embryonic
existence, during the hours of delicate cell division, indentation,
outpushing, elongation, and sliding of young cells&mdash;is it much
wonder, I repeat&mdash;that there occur a few malformations,
blemishes, or other accidents which persist as "birthmarks?"</p>

<h4>CAUSES OF BIRTHMARKS</h4>

<p>There are many factors which may enter into the production
of birth-blemishes, deformities, monstrosities, etc. These influences
are all governed by certain definite laws of cause and
effect. A pre-existent systemic disease in the father, or a coexistent
disorder in the mother, may be a leading factor. A
mechanical injury, such as a sudden fall, a blow, or a kick,
or certain kinds of prolonged pressure, not to mention restrictions
and contractions of the maternal bony structures, may
all possibly contribute something to these prenatal miscarriages
of growth and development. Maternal or prenatal embryonic
infections could bring about many sorts of birthmarks and
malformations. These defects might also be caused by certain
types of severe inflammatory disorders in the uterus during
the early days of pregnancy.</p>

<p>The same factors that produce the accidents of embryology
resulting in malformations or monstrosities in the human family,
are also operative in the case of our lesser brethren of the
animal kingdom, for monstrosities and birth-defects are very
common among the lower animals, notwithstanding the fact
that the animal mother probably does not "believe in birthmarks."</p>

<p>"It is a striking fact that during the nineteenth century,
the teratologists, those who have scientifically investigated the
causes of monstrosities and fetal morbid states, have almost<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
without exception, rejected the theory of maternal impressions."
Scientists and physicians are coming to recognize the
fact that fears and frights do not in any way act as causes in
the production of monstrosities and deformities. Let us seek
forever to liberate all womankind from the common and harassing
fear and the definite dread and worry that, because they
failed to control themselves at the instant of some terrifying
sight or experience, they were directly responsible for the misfortune
of their abnormal offspring.</p>

<p>It should be remembered that there exists no direct connection
whatsoever between the nervous system of the unborn
child and the nervous system of the mother. The only physiological
or embryological relationship is of a nutritional order,
and even that is indirect and remote.</p>

<h4>ROLE OF THE PLACENTA</h4>

<p>By the end of the third month, the "cocoon" attachment
described in chapter two has disappeared; the fetus is slowly
pushed away from the uterus which has so snugly held it for
more than eleven weeks; while upon the exact site of its previous
attachment the thickened uterine membrane undergoes a
very interesting and important change&mdash;definite blood vessels
begin to form&mdash;which begin indirectly to form contact with
the maternal vessels, and thus it is that the placenta, or "after
birth" is formed; and then, by means of the umbilical cord,
nourishment from the mother's blood-stream is carried to the
growing and rapidly developing child. In exchange for the
nourishing stream of life-giving fluid by which growth and
development take place, the embryo gives off its poisonous excretions
which are carried back to the placenta, from which
they are absorbed into the veinous circulation of the mother;
so, while the mother does, through the process of nutrition,
influence growth and development in the embryo, she is wholly
unable to produce specific changes and such definite developmental
errors as birthmarks and other deformities.</p>

<p>Just as truly as it would be impossible so to frighten a setting
hen as to "mark" or otherwise influence the form or character
of the chicks which would ultimately come forth from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
the eggs in her nest, it is just as truly impossible to frighten
the pregnant mother and thereby influence the final developmental
product of the human egg which is so securely tucked
away in its uterine nest; for, when conception has occurred,
the human embryo is just as truly an egg&mdash;fashioned and
formed&mdash;as is the larger and shell-contained embryo of the
chick which lies in the nest of the setting hen.</p>

<p>And so we are compelled to recognize the fact that there
is little more danger to the unborn child when the mother is
frightened than when the father is scared. The one contributes
as much as the other to the general character of the
child, while neither is to blame for development errors and
defects.</p>

<h4>SUGGESTION AND HEREDITY</h4>

<p>Certain fears are suggested to children. For twenty years
I lived under the delusion that I was terribly afraid of snakes&mdash;more
so than any other human being; for I was told when
a mere child that I had been "marked with the fear of snakes,"
that just two months before I saw the peep of day, my esteemed
mother had been terrified by a snake. Everywhere I went, I
announced to sympathizing and ofttimes mischievous friends,
that "I was marked with the fear of snakes and must never be
frightened with them." It is needless to add in passing, that
I was teased and frightened all through my girlhood days.
I was a veritable slave to the bondage of snake-fear. Everywhere
I went I looked for my dreaded foe, expecting to sit
on one, step on one, or to have one drop into my lap from the
roof.</p>

<p>The day of deliverance came after marriage, when in a
supreme effort to deliver me from the shackles of fear, the
goodman of the house tenderly, but firmly, maneuvered a morning
walk so that it halted in front of a large plate-glass window
of the Snake Drug Store in San Francisco. Just back of this
plate glass, and within eighteen inches of my very nose, were
fifty-seven varieties of the reptiles, big and small, streaked and
checkered, quiet and active. After much remonstrance and
waiting, I came-to&mdash;gazed at the markings, beautiful in their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
exactness&mdash;while slowly the change of mind took place. Faith
took the place of fear, calmness subdued panic, and I was
wondrously delivered from the veritable bondage of a score
of years. And so it is that the mother suffers and then the
child suffers, ofttimes a living death, because of the superstition
"I'm marked," while there is ever present the fear or
dread that "something is going to happen, because I'm different
from all other individuals&mdash;because 'I'm marked!'"</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IV</h2>
<h2>THE HYGIENE OF PREGNANCY</h2>
</div>

<p>As soon as a woman discovers that she is pregnant, she
should sit down and quietly think out the plan for the
nine months of expectancy.</p>

<p>The cessation of the menses may come as a surprise to her,
and for a while she is more or less confused; she must go
over the whole situation and adjust future plans to fit in with
this new and all important fact. From a large experience with
maternity cases, I have reached the conclusion that the larger
percentage of pregnancies do come as a surprise, and in many
instances a complete change of program must be painstakingly
thought out. This is especially true of the business woman,
the professional woman, the busy club woman, or the active
society woman.</p>

<h4>EARLY PLANNING</h4>

<p>Let me say to the woman who is pregnant for the first time,
the experiences of the pregnant state should cause you no fear,
worry, or anxiety. Giving birth to a baby is a perfectly natural,
normal procedure, and if you are in reasonable health&mdash;if
your physician tells you you are a fairly normal woman&mdash;then
you can dismiss further thought of danger and go on your way
rejoicing. For thousands of years maternity has been women's
exclusive profession and no doubt will continue to be many ages
hence.</p>

<p>By far the most important and the first thing to do is carefully
to select the best physician your means will allow, and
place yourself under his or her care. Your doctor will help
you to plan wisely and intelligently during the waiting time,
for physicians have learned from experience that the better<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
care the pregnant woman receives, the easier will be her labor,
and the more speedy and uneventful the recovery.</p>

<p>And now, we proceed to take up one by one the particular
phases of the hygiene of pregnancy which touch the comfort,
convenience, and health of both the mother and her unborn
child.</p>

<h4>THE CLOTHING</h4>

<p>At all times and under all circumstances the pregnant woman's
clothing should be comfortable, suitable for the occasion, artistic,
and practical. And to be thus beautifully clothed is to
be as inconspicuous as is possible. Of all times, occasions, and
conditions, that of pregnancy demands modesty in color, simplicity
in style, together with long straight lines (<a href="#illus-004">Fig. 2</a>). For
the "going out" dress, select soft shades of brown, blue, wine,
or dark green. Let the house dresses be simple, easy to launder,
without constricting waist bands, of the one-piece type, in every
way suitable for the work at hand. Under this outer dress, a
princess petticoat should cover a specially designed maternity
corset (if any corset at all be worn), to which is attached
side hose-supporters. A support for the breasts may be worn
if desired, it should be loose enough to allow perfect freedom
in breathing.</p>

<p>The union suit may be of linen, silk, or cotton, with the weight
suitable for the season. Stockings and shoes should be of a
comfortable type, straight last, low or medium heel and at
least as wide as the foot. There are two or three shoes on
the market that are particularly good, whose arches are flexible,
heels comfortable, straight last, and whose soles look very much
like the lines of the foot unclothed. This style is particularly
good during the maternity days. Painful feet are a great
strain upon the general nervous system. Who of us has not
seen women with strained, tense faces hobbling about in high-heeled,
narrow-toed shoes? And if we followed them we would
not only see tenseness and strain in the features of the face,
but could hear outbursts of temper on the least provocation.
Aching feet produce general irritability. If ease of body and
calmness of spirit is desired, wear shoes that are comfortable,
and the surprising part of it is that many of them are very good
looking.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 441px; padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
<a name="illus-004" id="illus-004"></a>
<img src="images/fig02.png" alt="Fig. 2. The &quot;Expectant&quot; Costume." title="Fig. 2. The &quot;Expectant&quot; Costume." width="441" height="662" /><br />
<span class="caption">Fig. 2. The "Expectant" Costume.</span>
<p style="font-size: 75%; ">The long lines, so admirable for maternity wear are portrayed in this
handsome afternoon costume. Tunic waist is made with shoulder yoke from
which fullness hangs in fine plaiting with panel at back, front and under
arms. The set in vest is of black-striped gold cloth trimmed with gold
thread crochet buttons and with tiny waistcoat of black moire. Sleeves
are of Georgette crepe. Loose adjustable girdle of black moire ribbon.
Full skirt is attached on elastic to china silk underbodice. Material
Crepe de chine or any other soft, clinging fabric.</p>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span></div>

<p>Toward the end of pregnancy ofttimes the feet swell, in
which instance larger shoes should be worn in connection with
the bandaging of the ankles and legs.</p>

<p>During the latter days of expectancy an abdominal supporter
may be worn advantageously. Much of the backache and heaviness
in the pelvis is entirely relieved by the supporting of the
pendulous abdomen with a well-fitted binder. An ordinary piece
of linen crash may be fitted properly by the taking in of darts
at the lower front edge; or elastic linen, or silk binder may be
secured; in fact, any binder that properly supports the abdomen
will answer the purpose.</p>

<p>It should be within the means of every pregnant woman to
have a neat, artistic out-door costume, for social, club and
church occasions (<a href="#illus-004">Fig. 2</a>). For no reason but illness should
an expectant mother shut herself up in doors.</p>

<p>True men and true women hold the very highest esteem for
the maternal state, and the opinion of all others matters not;
so joyfully go forth to the club, social event, concert, or church;
and to do this, you must have a well-designed, artistic dress.
The material does not matter much, but the shade and style are
important.</p>

<h4>DIET</h4>

<p>There are certain laws which govern the diet at all times;
for instance, the man who digs ditches requires more of a
certain element of food and more food in general, than does
the man who digs thoughts out of his brain. The growing
child requires somewhat different elements of food than does
an adult. In other words, "The diet should suit the times,
occasions, occupations, etc."</p>

<p>In the case of the expectant mother it should be remembered
that the child gains nine-tenths of its weight after the fifth
month of pregnancy, and it is, therefore, not necessary that
a woman shall begin "eating for two" until after the fifth
month. And since it is also true that the baby doubles its
weight during the last eight weeks of pregnancy, it follows that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
then is the time when special attention must be given to the
quantity as well as the quality of "mothers' food."</p>

<p>During the first five months, if the urine and blood-pressure
are normal, the "lady in waiting" should follow her usual
dietetic tastes and fancies so long as they do not distress or
cause indigestion. Because of the additional work of the
elimination of the fetal wastes, much water, seven or eight
glasses a day, should be taken; while one of the meals&mdash;should
there be three&mdash;may well consist largely of fruit. All
of the vegetables may be enjoyed; salads with simple dressings
and fruits may be eaten liberally. Of the breads, bran, whole
wheat, or graham are far better for the bowels than the finer
grain breads, or the hot breads.</p>

<p>Something fresh&mdash;raw&mdash;should be taken every day, such as
lettuce, radishes, cabbage salad, and fresh fruits.</p>

<p>If the prospective mother is accustomed to the liberal use of
meat, providing the blood-pressure and urine are normal, she
may be able to indulge in meat once a day. Many physicians
believe that the maternal woman should eat meat rather sparingly&mdash;from
once a day to once or twice or three times a
week.</p>

<p>Of the desserts, gelatine, junket, ice cream, sponge cake, and
fruit are far better than the rich pastries, which never fail even
in health to encourage indigestion and heart burn. The fruitades
are all good. Candies and other sweets may be eaten in
moderation. Alcohol should be avoided. Tea and coffee should
be restricted, and in many cases abandoned. For many, two
meals and a lunch of fruit or broth are better than three full
meals. There is a continual and increased accumulation of
waste matter which must be thrown off by the lungs, kidneys
bowels, and skin; so that clogging of one channel of elimination
makes more work for one or more of the other eliminative
organs.</p>

<p>Sometimes the craving for food is excessive, and the desire
to nibble between meals is quite troublesome. These unusual
feelings should be controlled or ignored. A glass of orangeade
will sometimes satisfy this unnatural craving. Save your appetite
for meal time&mdash;for a good appetite means good digestion<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
&mdash;all things equal. The woman who habitually eats between
meals is the sluggish, constipated individual who needs to acquire
self-control and learn self-mastery.</p>

<h4>WATER DRINKING</h4>

<p>Water is the circulating medium of the body, from which the
digestive secretions are formed, and by which the food is
assimilated and distributed to individual cells. And, finally,
water is the agent for dissolving and removing waste products
from the body through the various eliminating organs. We
literally live, think, and have our being, as it were, under water.
The tiny cell creatures of our bodies, from the humble bile
workers of the liver to the exalted thinking cells of the brain,
all carry on their work submerged. Accordingly, the amount
of water we drink each day, determines whether the liquids
circulating through our tissues shall be pure, fresh, and life-giving,
or stagnant, stale, and death-dealing.</p>

<p>Thirst is the expression of the nervous system, constituting
a call for water, the same as hunger represents a call for food.
Pure water, free from all foreign substances, is the best liquid
with which to quench this thirst.</p>

<p>It is just as important to supply abundance of water for
the proper bathing and cleansing of the internal parts of the
body, as it is to wash and bathe the external skin frequently.
The living tissues are just as literally soiled and dirtied by their
life action and their poisonous excretions, as is the skin soiled
by its excretions of sweat and poisonous solids. Thus the
regular drinking of water is absolutely necessary to enable the
body to enjoy its internal bath, and this internal cleansing is
just as grateful and refreshing to the cells and tissues, as is the
external bath to the nerves which exist in the skin.</p>

<p>The total amount of water necessary varies according to the
nature of one's work, the amount of sweating from the skin,
the moisture of the atmosphere, the amount of water in the
food, etc. We believe the average person requires about eight
glasses of liquid a day; that is, about two quarts. By the
word "glass" we refer to the ordinary glass or goblet, two
of which equal one pint. This amount of water should be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
increased, if anything, throughout pregnancy; while, during
the later months, the amount of water taken each day should
be at least doubled.</p>

<p>In the condemnation of so-called artificial beverages, an
exception should be made of the fruit juices. The fresh,
unfermented juices of various fruits come very near being
pure, distilled water, as they consist of only a little fruit sugar
and acid, together with small amounts of flavoring and coloring
substances, dissolved in pure water. None of these substances
contained in pure fruit juice needs to be digested.</p>

<p>Lemonade not too sweet, and taken in moderate quantities,
is certainly a beverage free from objection when used by the
average pregnant woman. Unripe or overripe fruits frequently
cause bowel disturbances; as also do the millions of germs
which lurk upon the outside of fruits, and which find their
way into the stomach and bowels when these fruits are eaten
raw without washing or paring. Otherwise, the juices of fruits
and melons are wholesome food beverages when consumed in
moderation.</p>

<h4>EXERCISE</h4>

<p>It should be the regular practice of every expectant mother
to spend a portion of each day in agreeable, suitable exercise or
physical work of some description. This exercise will be far
more beneficial if it can be taken in the open air. The weather
and the strength of the patient must be taken into consideration
and the necessary modifications of the daily exercise should be
made.</p>

<p>An expectant mother living in the city and enjoying the
average health and strength, should engage in such agreeable
exercise as the raising of flowers, the training of vines, with
brisk walks in the fresh air. As much time as possible should
be spent in the parks.</p>

<p>The rural "mother in waiting," may do light gardening, raising
of chickens, or pigeons, training of vines, or other outdoor
work she may enjoy.</p>

<p>No matter what kind of weather prevails, a daily brisk walk
should be taken, out of doors, on the porch or in a room with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
open windows. A daily sweat, as well as the daily prayer, is
good for the well-being of the expectant mother. All forms
of light housework are commendable. Keep out of crowds.
Spend more time in the parks than in the department stores.
An occasional evening at the concert or theater is diversion
and harmless provided the ventilation is good. Such exercises
as horseback riding, bicycling, dancing, driving over rough
roads, lifting and straining of any kind, and all other forms of
fatiguing exercise should be avoided.</p>

<h4>REST</h4>

<p>Rest and relaxation are quite necessary for men and women
even in the best of health. A kind providence has arranged
that we spend a large portion of our time resting, and sleeping.
In addition to unbroken rest at night it is well for the prospective
mother quietly to withdraw from the family circle,
when the first signs of fatigue begin to appear, and indulge in
a little rest, before she gets into a state of nervousness&mdash;where
nerves twitch and she becomes irritable.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A mother who has borne six children, who has had little domestic
help, and who yet retains her youthful appearance and energy, thinks
her present condition due to the fact that while carrying and nursing
her babies she never permitted herself to reach that stage of exhaustion
where her nerves twitched, her voice shrilled, and she became
irritable. She made it a practice to drop her work when these
symptoms began to appear, and to seek the sanctuary of a quiet room
apart from her family, if only for ten or fifteen minutes. And,
most important, from the very start she trained her household to
respect her right thus to draw apart.</p></div>

<p>I have told many women whose household duties press
hard: "Your husband would rather see a cold lunch on the
table, or 'go out' for dinner, while his wife rested, smiling
and happy, than to have a most sumptuous meal spread before
him and the wife tired, and fretful." Every woman should
make it the rule of her life to stop just this side of the outburst
of words, and lie down long enough, breathing deeply, to calm
the spirit.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span></p>

<h4>FRESH AIR</h4>

<p>"With all persons plenty of fresh air, night and day, is
indispensable to health, and to none more than the pregnant
woman. She should sleep with the windows open, or out of
doors, at all seasons of the year; of course, making due allowance
for the severity of the winters in the North. It is not
only necessary to provide for the adequate ventilation of
sleeping-rooms, but also for that of the living-rooms of the
house.</p>

<p>Many persons, who are quite particular to open wide the
windows of the bedrooms, forget that the other rooms need it
quite as much. All the rooms of the house which are occupied
should be thoroughly ventilated by throwing doors and windows
open every morning; at night when the family is assembled the
air must be changed now and then or it will become unfit for
human lungs."</p>

<p>Men and women are outdoor animals. They were made to
live in a garden, not a house. Remember that each person
requires one cubic foot of fresh air every second. Don't allow
the temperature of living-rooms, during the winter season, to
go above sixty-eight degrees. If your home has no system of
ventilation, open wide the windows and doors several times a
day and enjoy the blessings of a thorough-going flushing with
fresh air.</p>

<p>Oxygen is the vital fire of life. Our food, however well
digested and assimilated, is just as useless to the body without
oxygen, as coal is to the furnace without air. It is equally
important to keep up the proper degree of moisture in the air
of the living-rooms.</p>

<h4>BATHING</h4>

<p>Bathing is made necessary by the clothes we wear and by
our indoor life. If the skin were daily exposed to sunshine and
fresh air, it would seldom be necessary to bathe. The neglect
of regular bathing results in overworking the liver and kidneys,
and debilitates the skin. Regular bathing&mdash;ofttimes sweating
baths&mdash;is very essential to the hygiene of pregnancy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span></p>

<p>The neutral bath (97 F.) is excellent to quiet the nerves
and induce sleep. Morning bathing is an exceedingly valuable
practice. If properly taken before breakfast or midway between
breakfast and lunch, it is found to be refreshing and tonic in
nature. The feet should be in warm water, the application of
cold should be short and vigorous. A rough mit dipped in cold
water, rubbed over the body until the skin is pink, is a splendid
tonic.</p>

<p>Warm cleansing baths should be taken twice a week at night.
There is no good reason for the use of the vaginal douche
during pregnancy.</p>

<h4>THE TEETH</h4>

<p>Because the mother's system is drained of the lime salts
which aid in building up the bones of the child, along with
other metabolic changes which cause the retention of certain
acids which ofttimes affect the teeth, they should be frequently
examined and carefully guarded. Severe dental work should
be avoided, but all cavities should receive temporary fillings
while the teeth are kept free from deposits.</p>

<p>As a preventive to this tendency of the teeth to decay, a
simple mouth wash of one of the following may be used after
meals:</p>

<ol style=" margin-bottom: 0em; ">
<li>One teaspoon of milk magnesia.</li>
<li>One tablespoon of lime water.</li>
<li>One-half teaspoon common baking soda.</li>
</ol>
<p style=" margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 1em;">Any one to be dissolved in a glass of water.</p>

<h4>DIRECTIONS FOR SAVING URINE SPECIMENS</h4>

<p>Beginning with the second voiding of urine after rising on
the morning of the day you are to save the specimen, save all
that is passed during the following twenty-four hours, including
the first voiding on the second morning. Measure carefully the
total quantity passed in the twenty-four hours. Shake thoroughly
so that all the sediment will be mixed, and immediately
after shaking take out eight ounces or thereabouts for delivery
to the physician the same forenoon. The following items<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
should be noted, and this memoranda should accompany the
specimen:</p>

<p>1. Patient's name.</p>

<p>2. Address.</p>

<p>3. This specimen was taken from a twenty-four hour voiding
of urine, which began at .... <span class="smcap">a. m.</span> ...., and ended at
.... <span class="smcap">a. m.</span> ....</p>

<p>4. The total quantity voided during this twenty-four hours
was .... pints.</p>

<p>This specimen should reach the laboratory by ten o'clock
the same morning.</p>

<p>It is of utmost importance the specimen should be taken to
your physician every two weeks, and oftener if conditions
indicate it. Take it yourself at the appointed time.</p>

<h4>THE BOWELS</h4>

<p>Owing to the increasing pressure exerted upon the intestines,
most expectant mothers experience a tendency to sluggish
bowels and constipation. This unpleasant symptom is usually
increased during the later months.</p>

<p>In the first place, a definite time must be selected for bowel
action. It may ofttimes be necessary, and it is far less harmful,
to insert a glycerine suppository into the rectum, than to get
into the enema habit. The injection of a large quantity of
water into the lower bowel will mechanically empty it; but the
effects are atonic and depressing as regards future action.</p>

<p>Before we take up the advisability of taking laxatives let us
consider what foods will aid in combating constipation. The
following list of foods are laxative in their action and will
be found helpful in overcoming the constipation so often associated
with pregnancy:</p>

<p>1. All forms of sugar, especially fruit sugar, honey, syrup,
and malt. All the concentrated fruit juices. Sweet fruits, such
as figs, raisins, prunes, fruit jellies, etc.</p>

<p>2. All sour fruits, and fruit acids: Apples, grapes, gooseberries,
grape fruit, currants, plums, and tomatoes.</p>

<p>3. Fruit juices, especially from sour fruits: Grape juice,
lemonade, fruit soup, etc.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span></p>

<p>4. All foods high in fat: Butter, cream, eggs, eggnog, ripe
olives, olive oil, nuts&mdash;especially pecans, brazil nuts, and pine
nuts.</p>

<p>5. Buttermilk and koumiss.</p>

<p>6. All foods rich in cellulose: Wheat flakes, asparagus,
cauliflower, spinach, sweet potatoes, green corn and popcorn,
graham flour, oatmeal foods, whole-wheat preparations, bran
bread, apples, blackberries, cherries, cranberries, melons,
oranges, peaches, pineapples, plums, whortleberries, raw cabbage,
celery, greens, lettuce, onions, parsnips, turnips, lima
beans, and peanuts.</p>

<p>White bread should be tabooed, and in its place a well-made
bran bread should be used. Two recipes for bran bread follow,
one sweetened and containing fruit, the other unsweetened:</p>

<h4>BRAN BREAD RECIPES</h4>

<p>1. Two eggs, beaten separately; three-fourths cup of molasses,
plus one round teaspoon of soda; one cup of sour cream; one cup
of sultana seedless raisins; one cup of wheat flour, plus one
heaping teaspoon baking powder; two cups of bran; stir well
and bake one hour.</p>

<p>2. One cup of cooking molasses; one teaspoon of soda; one
small teaspoon of salt, one pint of sour milk or buttermilk,
one quart of bran, one pint of flour. Stir well, and bake for
one hour in a very slow oven. It may be baked in loaf, or
in gem pans, as preferred. The bread should be moist and
tender, and may be eaten freely, day after day, and is quite
sure to have a salutary effect if used persistently.</p>

<p>The drinking of one-half glass of cold water on rising in
the morning often aids in keeping the bowels active. Of the
laxative drugs which may be used at such a time, cascara
sagrada and senna are among the least harmful. Two recipes
of senna preparation follow, and may be tried in obstinate cases:</p>

<p>1. <i>Senna Prunes.</i> Place an ounce of senna leaves in a jar
and pour over them a quart of boiling water. After allowing
them to stand for two hours strain, and to the clear liquid add a
pound of well-washed prunes. Let them soak over night. In
the morning cook until tender in the same water, sweetening<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
with two tablespoons of brown sugar. Both the fruit and
the sirup are laxative. Begin by eating a half-dozen of the
prunes with sirup at night, and increase or decrease the amount
as may be needed.</p>

<p>2. <i>Senna with prunes and figs.</i> This recipe does not call
for cooking. Take a pound of dried figs and a pound of dried
prunes, wash well. Remove the stones from the prunes and if
very dry soak for an hour. Then put both fruits through the
meat chopper, adding two ounces of finely powdered senna
leaves. Stir into this mixture two tablespoons of molasses to
bind it together, the result being a thick paste. Begin by eating
at bedtime an amount equal to the size of an egg, and increase
or decrease as may be necessary. Keep the paste tightly covered
in a glass jar in a cool place. If the senna is distasteful
a smaller quantity may be used at first.</p>

<h4>CARE OF THE BREASTS</h4>

<p>The breasts are usually neglected during the months of
pregnancy, and as a result complications occur after the baby
comes which cause no end of discomfort to the mother. If,
during the pregnancy, the breasts are washed daily with liquid
soap and cold water, and rubbed increasingly until all sensitiveness
has disappeared, they may be toughened to the extent that
no pain whatsoever is experienced by the mother when the babe
begins to nurse. During the last month of pregnancy a solution
of tannin upon a piece of cotton may be applied after the usual
vigorous bathing. If the nipples are retracted they should be
massaged until visible results are attained.</p>

<h4>THE MENTAL STATE</h4>

<p>Keep the mind occupied with normal, useful, and healthy
thoughts. Listen to no tales of woe. Stay away from the
neighborhood auntie dolefuls. Keep yourself happy and free
from all worry, care, and anxiety.</p>

<p>"Put no faith in fables of cravings, markings, signs, or
superstitions. They are all unfounded vagaries of ignorant
old women and will not bear investigation."</p>

<p>Don't take drugs for worry and sleeplessness. Take a bath.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span></p>

<p>The secret of deliverance from worrying is self-control.
Minimize your difficulties. Cultivate faith and trust.</p>

<p>The conditions which favor sound sleep are: Quiet, mental
peace, pure blood, good digestion, fresh air (the colder the
better), physical weariness (but not fatigue), mental weariness
(but not worry).</p>

<p>When tempted to borrow trouble, when harassed by fictitious
worries, remember the old man who had passed through many
troubles, most of which never happened. Train the mind to
think positive thoughts. Replace worry-thought with an opposite
thought which will occupy the mind and enthuse the soul.
Drive out fear-thought by exercising faith-thought. Cultivate
the art of living with yourself as you are, and with the world
as it is. Learn the art of living easily. Associate with children
and learn how to forget the vexing trifles of everyday life.</p>

<p>There is something decidedly wrong with one's nerves when
everybody is constantly "getting on them." They are either
highly diseased or abnormally sensitive. Every woman is a
slave to every other that annoys her.</p>

<p>Fear is capable of so disarranging the circulation as to contribute
to the elevation of blood-pressure&mdash;which will be more
fully considered in a later chapter.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>
<h2>COMPLICATIONS OF PREGNANCY</h2>
</div>

<p>It is the purpose of this chapter to take up the various complications
which may appear in the course of an otherwise
normal pregnancy, and offer advice appropriate for their
management.</p>

<h4>MORNING SICKNESS</h4>

<p>About one-half of the expectant mothers that come under
our care and observation, experience varying degrees of nausea
or "morning sickness." This troublesome symptom makes its
appearance usually about the fourth week of pregnancy and
lasts from six to eight weeks.</p>

<p>On attempting to rise from the bed, there is an uncomfortably
warm feeling in the stomach followed by a welling up into the
throat of a warmish, brackish tasting liquid which causes the
patient to hasten to rid herself of it; or, as she rides on the
train, on the street cars, in a carriage or automobile, she frequently
senses the same unpleasant and nauseating symptoms
during the second and third months of pregnancy. Normally,
this uncomfortable symptom quite disappears by the end of the
third month. A number of remedies have been suggested for
it, but that which seems to help one, gives little or no relief to
another; we therefore mention a variety of remedies which
may be tried.</p>

<p>First and most important of all remedies&mdash;is to keep the
bowels open. Sluggishness of the intestinal tract greatly
increases the tendency to dizziness and nausea. During the
attack, it is advisable not to attempt to brush the teeth, gargle,
or even drink cold water. While you are yet lying down, the
maid or the goodman of the house should bring to you a piece<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
of dry, buttered toast, a lettuce sandwich with a bit of lemon
juice, or perhaps a cup of hot milk or hot malted milk. Coffee
helps to raise the blood-pressure, and all articles of diet that
tend to raise the blood-pressure are best avoided during pregnancy.
A cup of cocoa may be tried, but, as a rule, women at
this time do not relish anything sweet. Oftentimes a salted
pretzel is just the thing, or a salted wafer will greatly help.
Remain in bed from one-half to one hour and then rise very
slowly. There should be plenty of fresh air in the room, as
remaining in overheated places is quite likely to produce a feeling
of sickness at the stomach.</p>

<p>When the attack comes on during a train ride, open the
window and breathe deeply, this, with the aid of a clove or the
tasting of a bit of lemon, will usually give relief. In extreme
instances the patient should lie down flatly on the back, with
the eyelids closed. Go to the rear of the street car, so that you
can get off quickly if necessity demands; breathe deeply of the
air; resort to the use of cloves or lemons; and thus by many
and varied methods will the expectant mother be enabled to continue
her journey or finish her shopping errand. We would
suggest that, as far as possible, walking should be substituted
for riding. I have never heard of a woman being troubled with
nausea while walking in the parks, on shady streets, along the
country road, or on the beach.</p>

<p>Of the medicines prescribed for "morning sickness" and the
nausea of pregnancy, cerium oxalate taken three times a day in
doses of five grains each, is probably one of the best.</p>

<p>The persistent or pernicious vomiting which continues on
through pregnancy will be spoken of later.</p>

<h4>HEARTBURN</h4>

<p>Acid eructations are spoken of as "heartburn," and are
occasioned by the increased activity of the acid making glands
of the stomach. Under certain conditions this acid content
of the stomach is regurgitated back into the throat and even
belched up into the mouth. In this condition it is well to avoid
most acid fruits. Ice cream and other frozen desserts are
beneficial. The lowered temperature of cold foods depresses<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
the activity of the acid glands, as also does the fats of the
cream, while protein food substances such as white of egg,
cheese, and lean meat, help by combining with the excess of
acid present in the stomach. Buttermilk or the prepared lactic
acid milk, if taken very cold, is often helpful, notwithstanding
it is an acid substance, in connection with the dietetic management
of heartburn. If the acid eructations be troublesome
between the meals, the taking of calcined magnesia (one round
teaspoon in a glass of cold water), or, one-half teaspoon of
common baking soda in a glass of water, will afford immediate
and temporary relief. Simply nibbling a little from a block of
magnesia will often give instant relief. These alkalines effectively
neutralize the mischievous acids which cause the so-called
"heartburn."</p>

<h4>IRRITABILITY OF THE BLADDER</h4>

<p>The flexing or bending forward of the gravid uterus, by making
pressure on the bladder, sets up more or less irritation and
consequent disturbance of the urinary function. The capacity
of the bladder is actually diminished, and this produces frequent
urination. There is usually no pain connected with this annoying
symptom&mdash;the chief discomfort is the frequent getting up
at night. This inconvenience may be lessened by drinking less
water after six <span class="smcap">p. m.</span> These bladder disturbances are most
marked in the earlier months, and gradually disappear as the
uterus raises higher up into the abdomen; although this symptom
may reappear in the last two weeks, as the head descends downward
on its outward journey.</p>

<p>Should the urine at any time become highly colored, take a
specimen to your physician at once. Twenty-four hour specimens
of urine should be taken by the patient to her physician
every two weeks. Do not send it&mdash;take it.</p>

<h4>LEUCORRHEA</h4>

<p>While leucorrhea is an unusual complication of pregnancy,
it is often very troublesome and sometimes irritating. Do not
take a vaginal douche unless it has been ordered by your physician,
and even then make sure that the force of the flow of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
water is very gentle. The bag of the fountain syringe should
be hung only about one foot above the hips. Soap and water
used externally, followed by vaseline or zinc ointment, will
usually relieve the accompanying irritation.</p>

<h4>THREATENED ABORTION</h4>

<p>In the third chapter attention was called to the formation of
the placenta or "after birth," on the site of the attachment of
the cocoon embryo. At this particular time of the pushing away
of the embryo from the uterine wall, one of the accidents of
pregnancy occurs, in which the embryo becomes completely
detached and starts to escape from the uterus, accompanied by
varying degrees of pain and hemorrhage. The symptoms of
this threatened abortion are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Heavy menstrual pains.</li>
<li>Backache.</li>
<li>Hemorrhage.</li>
</ol>

<p>The approach of the calendar date of the third month of
pregnancy should be watched for, and all work of a strenuous
nature studiously avoided; while at the first signs of the backache
or any unusual symptom, the expectant mother should
immediately go to bed and send for the physician. One patient
who had aborted on four different occasions was able to pass
this danger period by adhering to a rigid program of prevention
during her fifth pregnancy. Two weeks before the
third month arrived she discontinued her teaching and went
to bed. She remained there four weeks, thus running over into
the middle of the following month. Gradually, she resumed her
duties of teaching, carried her precious bundle of life to full
term, and is now the proud and happy mother of a splendid
baby girl.</p>

<p>Should abortion seem imminent, from one-eighth to one-fourth
of a grain of morphine sulphate will greatly reduce all
uterine contractions, and this, with the general quieting effect
on the whole system, will usually suffice to prevent an abortion.
The patient should quietly remain in bed from three days to one
week.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>

<p>If the abortion takes place&mdash;if a clot accompanied by hemorrhage
is passed&mdash;save everything, lie in bed very quietly and
send for your physician at once; and when he does arrive, be
content if he does not make an internal examination at once,
for if he should there is more or less danger of infection. And
I repeat&mdash;throw nothing away&mdash;burn nothing up, save everything
that passes until your physician has carefully examined it.</p>

<h4>SUDDEN ABDOMINAL PAIN</h4>

<p>Sudden or severe pains in the abdomen should be reported at
once to your physician, while you should immediately go to bed
and quietly remain there until you receive further instruction
from your doctor when he calls.</p>

<p>In the later stages of pregnancy any appearance of blood
should likewise be noted and reported without delay. These
symptoms may not always be serious, but they are also associated
with grave complications, and should, therefore, be given
prompt attention.</p>

<h4>MISCARRIAGE</h4>

<p>Abortion is a term used to designate the loss of the embryo
prior to or at the third month. Miscarriage applies to the
expulsion of the fetus or emptying of the uterus after the
third month. It is possible for a miscarriage to occur anytime
during the interim between the fourth and ninth months. After
the uneventful passing of the third month, if an accident threatens,
we instruct the mother to remain quietly in bed three to
five days at the calendar date comparable with each menstrual
period; and as she approaches the seventh month, we adjure
her to be unusually careful and prudent.</p>

<p>The causes of miscarriages are many: Disease of the embryo,
imperfect fetal development, some constitutional disease of the
mother, a faulty position of the uterus, or it may result from
something unusual about the lining of the uterus such as an
endometritis&mdash;an inflammation of the mucus membrane.</p>

<p>Expectant mothers who manifest symptoms of a threatened
miscarriage should studiously avoid such exercises as climbing,
riding, skating, tennis, golf, dancing, rough carriage or auto<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>mobile
riding, and such taxing labor as sweeping, lifting, washing,
running the sewing machine, window cleaning, the hanging
of pictures, draperies, etc.</p>

<h4>CRAVINGS</h4>

<p>Within reason, a pregnant mother should follow her natural
appetite and satisfy her dietetic longings. Should she desire
unusual articles of food, as far as possible she should have
them. The idea has long prevailed that if the mother does not
get what her longing soul supremely desires, that the on-coming
baby is going to cry and cry until it is given what the mother
wanted with all her heart and did not get. Such an idea is the
very quintessence of folly and the personification of foolishness
and superstition.</p>

<p>Many a precious babe has suffered as a victim of this notion
of "craving" and "marking." One mother gave her baby a
huge mouthful of under-ripe banana because "she knew that
was just what he wanted, because, when pregnant, she had
craved and craved bananas and for some reason or another she
did not get them." The soft, smooth piece of banana slipped
down the baby's throat&mdash;on into the stomach and intestines&mdash;caused
intestinal obstruction and finally the end came; and we
registered one more victim to the fallacies of fear and the
superstitious belief in "cravings" and "markings." Occasionally
some cravings are unusual and freakish, for instance, egg
shells, leather, candles, chalk, and other abnormal tastes are
developed. Of these we have only to say, "Rise above them,
become mistress of the situation and change your longings."
If such abnormal cravings come to you in the kitchen, don your
bonnet and go at once out of doors and take a walk. Don't be
foolish just because somebody told you foolish stories about
these things.</p>

<h4>CONSTIPATION</h4>

<p>Bowel hygiene is an important part of the management of
pregnancy. Constipation often proves to be very troublesome.
In another chapter this subject is treated at some length. Here,
we pause only long enough to say that habit has much to do<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
with this difficulty. A regular time should be set apart each
day for attending to this important matter.</p>

<h4>HEMORRHOIDS</h4>

<p>Of all the maladies that the human family falls heir to, hemorrhoids
are among the commonest and, we may add, the most
neglected. Any woman who enters pregnancy, suffering from
hemorrhoids, is going to have her full share of suffering and
pain before she has finished with her labors. Taken early,
they may be greatly helped, if not entirely relieved, by the
daily use of the medicated suppository (See <a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a>). The
bowel movements should never be allowed to become hard, the
dietetic advice of another chapter should be carefully followed
and the oil enema, as described in the appendix, should be used
if necessary. For immediate relief, hot witch-hazel compresses
may be applied; or, in the case of badly protruding piles, the
patient should immerse the body in a warm bath and by the
liberal use of vaseline they can usually be replaced. The physician
should be called and he will advise any further treatment
the case may require.</p>

<h4>VARICOSE VEINS</h4>

<p>Varicose veins or the distension of the surface veins of the
legs are very common among women in general and pregnant
women in particular. The legs should be elevated whenever
the patient sits, while in bad cases they should be bandaged
while standing. There are many elastic surgical stockings on
the market today that, if put on before rising in the morning,
will give much relief and comfort all during the day. Any large
medical house or physician's supply house can furnish them
according to your measurements&mdash;which should be taken before
getting out of bed in the morning. These measurements are
taken according to instructions and usually are of the instep,
ankle, calf of leg, length of ankle to knee, etc.</p>

<h4>CRAMPS</h4>

<p>Cramps are sharp, exceedingly painful muscular spasms occurring
in the muscles of the calf of the leg, the toes, etc. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
expectant mother in the later months of pregnancy awkwardly
turns in bed, is suddenly awakened and without a moment's
warning, is seized with a most excruciating pain in her leg or
toe. The most effectual treatment for these cramps is quickly
to apply a very cold object to the cramping muscle. Extremes
of either heat or cold usually relieve as well as the vigorous
grasping or kneading of the muscle. A hot foot bath on going
to bed will often prevent an attack. A long walk in the latter
months of pregnancy should invariably be followed by a short
hot bath or a foot bath. Many attacks may be avoided by this
procedure.</p>

<h4>SWELLINGS</h4>

<p>All swellings should be taken seriously by the pregnant mother
to this extent, that she save a twenty-four hour specimen of
urine and that she personally take it to her physician, with a
report of her "swellings." This symptom may or may not
indicate kidney complications. The blood-pressure together with
chemical and microscopical analysis of the urine will determine
the cause.</p>

<p>Slight swelling of the feet is often physiological and is due
to pressure of the heavily weighted uterus upon the returning
veins of the legs. The progress of the veinous blood is somewhat
impeded, hence the accumulation of lymph in the tissues
of the legs, ankles, and feet.</p>

<p>Never allow yourself to guess as to the cause of swellings,
always take urine to the physician and allow him definitely to
ascertain the true cause. All tight bands of the waist and knee
garters must be discarded at this time. The same general
treatment suggested for varicose veins holds here.</p>

<h4>GOITRE</h4>

<p>The enlargement of the thyroid gland&mdash;goitre&mdash;is physiological
during pregnancy, and is believed to be caused by the
throwing into the maternal blood stream of special protein
substances derived from the fetus. As just stated, this is more
or less physiological, will usually pass away after the babe is
born, and, therefore, need give the mother no particular con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>cern.
Tight neck bands should be replaced by low, comfortable
ones. The bowels should move freely every day, and water
drinking be increased as well as sweating of the skin encouraged
by a short, hot bath, followed by the dry blanket pack,
while the head is kept cool by compresses wrung from cold
water. In this manner the elimination of these poisons is
increased through both the skin and the kidneys.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 3. The Photophore.</span>
</div>

<h4>BACKACHE</h4>

<p>The backache of the later months of expectancy is very
annoying and often spoils an otherwise restful night's sleep.
This is probably also a pressure symptom, if the physician's
analysis of the urine proves that the kidneys are not at fault.
If you have electric lights in the home, a very useful contrivance
can be made which will give you great relief. The light end of
an extension cord, five to seven feet in length, is soldered into
the center of the bottom of a bright, pressed tin pail about
twelve inches in diameter at the top and nine or ten inches
deep. With the bail removed, screw in a sixteen or thirty-two
candle power bulb and attach the extension cord to a nearby<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
wall or ceiling socket. This arrangement supplies radiant heat
and is called a photophore (See <a href="#illus-005">Fig. 3</a>). Apply this twofold
remedial agent&mdash;light and heat combined&mdash;to the painful back
(underneath the bed clothing) and our restless mother will go
to sleep very quickly. This may safely be used as often and as
long as desired.</p>

<h4>PERNICIOUS VOMITING</h4>

<p>Persistent, prolonged, and very much aggravated cases of
morning sickness are termed pernicious vomiting. The patient
emaciates because of the lack of ability to keep food long
enough to receive any benefits therefrom.</p>

<p>In treating these cases the sufferer should be put to bed in
a room with many open windows, or, if the weather permit,
should be out of doors on a comfortable cot. She should
remain in bed one hour before the meal is served and from
one to three hours afterward. The mind should be diverted
from her condition by good reading, friends, or other amusements.
The utmost care and tact should be used in the preparation
of her food, and art should be manifested in the daintiness
of the tray, etc. We found one mother was nauseated even
at the sight of her tray and so we planned a call that should
bring us to her home at the meal hour. The tray came in with
the attendant in unkempt attire, who said, as she placed it carelessly
down on a much-loved book our patient had been reading:
"I heard you say you liked vegetable soup so I brought you a
big bowl full." As I gazed at the tray, I saw a large, thick,
gravy bowl running over with the soup. I usually like vegetable
soup, but at the sight of that sloppy looking bowl&mdash;well, I
thought I should never care for it again.</p>

<p>After installing a new maid who had a sense of service and
daintiness, and who took real pleasure in the selection of the
dishes for the tray, as well as the quality and quantity of food
served in them, our patient made speedy recovery, went on to
full term and became a happy mother.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the mind has very much to do with
this vexing complication of pregnancy. One mother immediately
stopped vomiting everything she ate when told by her<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
husband that "the doctor said he was coming in the morning
to take you away from me to the hospital if you didn't stop
vomiting." Everything known should be tried for the relief
of these patients and in extreme cases, when the mother's life
is endangered, pregnancy should be terminated.</p>

<h4>INSOMNIA</h4>

<p>The neutral full bath, temperature 97 F., maintained for
twenty minutes to one-half hour, should be taken just on going
to bed. The patient must not talk&mdash;must rest in the bath&mdash;absolutely
quiet. The causes of insomnia should be determined
if possible, and proper measures employed to remove them.
They may consist of backache, cramps, frequent urination,
pressure of the uterus on the diaphragm or pressure against
the sides of the abdomen. The bed should be large, thus giving
the patient ample room to roll about.</p>

<p>The following procedures may be tried in an effort to relieve
the sleeplessness:</p>

<p>Rubbing of the spine, alcohol or witch-hazel rubbing of the
entire body, the neutral bath, or the application of the electric
photophore&mdash;described a few pages back&mdash;may be made to
the painful part. <i>Do not resort to drugs</i>, unless you are directed
to do so by your physician.</p>

<h4>HEADACHE</h4>

<p>Headaches should not be allowed to continue unobserved by
the attending physician. Measure the daily output of urine,
which should be at least three pints or two quarts. In case of
daily or frequent headaches, notify your physician at once and
take a twenty-four hour specimen of urine to him. Headache
is an early symptom of retained poisons and if early reported
to the physician quick relief can be given the patient and often
severe kidney complications be avoided by the proper administration
of early sweating procedures. Water drinking should
be increased to two quarts (about ten glasses) a day. Less food
and more water are the usual indications in the headaches of
pregnancy.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span></p>

<h4>HIGH BLOOD-PRESSURE</h4>

<p>Blood-pressure is called <i>high</i> when the systolic pressure
registers above 150 to 160 millimeters of mercury. Pressure
above 165 should be taken seriously and the patient should keep
in close touch with her physician. Tri-weekly examinations of
the urine should be made, while eliminating baths should be
promptly instituted. The subject of blood-pressure in relation
to pregnancy will be fully dealt with in the next chapter&mdash;in
connection with toxemia, eclampsia, etc.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VI</h2>
<h2>TOXEMIA AND ITS SYMPTOMS</h2>
</div>

<p>At the close of the preceding chapter on the complications of
pregnancy, brief mention was made of blood-pressure as a
possible source of anxiety. This chapter will be devoted to a
further discussion of the subjects of toxemia, eclampsia, convulsions,
and especially blood-pressure&mdash;in connection with
other leading symptoms of these serious complications of pregnancy.</p>

<h4>TOXIC SYMPTOMS</h4>

<p>In a former chapter we learned that the developing child
nearly doubled its weight in the last two months of pregnancy.
As the child grows, its metabolic waste matter is greatly
increased, while all these poisonous substances must finally be
eliminated by the mother. Now, the mother's waste matter is
of itself considerably increased; and so, if the kidneys, the liver,
and the skin are already over-taxed in their work of normal
elimination&mdash;if they are already doing their full quota of
work&mdash;we can readily see that the additional waste matter
of the unborn child will throw much extra work on the already
overworked eliminative organs, and this results in a condition
of toxemia. Certain symptoms accompany this state of constitutional
poisoning or auto-intoxication&mdash;the chief of which are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Headache.</li>
<li>Dizziness.</li>
<li>Blurring of the vision.</li>
<li>Swelling of the feet and hands, or puffiness of the face.</li>
<li>Diminished urine.</li>
<li>Vomiting.</li>
<li>High blood-pressure.</li>
<li>Albumin and casts in the urine.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span></li>
</ol>

<p>Any one of these symptoms may or may not indicate toxemia;
but it should be reported at once to the attending physician.
In the presence of one or more of these symptoms an expectant
mother is always safe, while awaiting the physician's advice,
in carrying out the following program:</p>

<ol>
<li>Drink more water or lemonade.</li>
<li>Take a mild cathartic.</li>
<li>Avoid eating much meat and other highly protein foods.</li>
</ol>

<h4>CONVULSIONS OF PREGNANCY</h4>

<p>This serious complication of the last weeks of pregnancy
demands immediate attention. They may almost invariably be
avoided if the blood-pressure and the urine are studiously
watched during the latter part of the expectant period.</p>

<p>If you are unable to get your physician at once, the following
treatment should be administered immediately.</p>

<p>1. A hot colonic flushing (See <a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a>).</p>
<p>2. A hot bath followed by the hot blanket pack (See <a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a>).</p>
<p>3. One drop of croton oil on a bit of sugar may be placed
on the back of the tongue.</p>
<p>4. Chloroform may be administered, provided a competent
nurse or other medical person is present.</p>

<p>The appearance of convulsions which have been preceded by
one or more of the symptoms noted under the head of "toxemia,"
indicates that the patient has become so profoundly
intoxicated and poisoned by the accumulating toxins, that the
lives of both mother and child are jeopardized by threatened
eclampsia. At such a time, the attending physician will immediately
set about to bring on labor, and thus seek to empty the
uterus at the earliest possible moment.</p>

<h4>CARDINAL SYMPTOMS OF TOXICITY</h4>

<p>Since toxemia (eclampsia) is one of the complications of
pregnancy most to be dreaded, it is fortunate that it almost
invariably exhibits early danger signals which, if recognized
and heeded, would enable the patient and physician to initiate
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>proper measures to avert danger and escape the threatened
disaster. The presence of this toxic danger is indicated by the
persistent presence of the following three symptoms:</p>

<ol>
<li>Persistent, dull headache.</li>
<li>Presence of casts in the urine.</li>
<li>Persistent high blood-pressure, with tendency to increase.</li>
</ol>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 438px; padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em">
<a name="illus-006" id="illus-006"></a>
<img src="images/fig04.jpg" alt="Fig. 4. Taking the Blood Pressure." title="" width="438" height="670" /><br />
<span class="caption">Fig. 4. Taking the Blood Pressure.</span>
</div>

<p>Of course, albumin will probably appear in the urine along
with the casts, but it is the continued appearance of the casts
that is of more importance as a danger signal. Albumin is
quite common in the urine of the expectant mother, but casts&mdash;long
continued&mdash;suggest trouble. Headache as an indicator
of toxemia is of special significance when coupled with the
other two cardinal symptoms of eclampsia&mdash;urinary casts and
increasing high blood-pressure. Therefore, the necessity for
frequent urinary tests and blood-pressure examinations during
the last weeks of pregnancy&mdash;especially, if the patient has suffered
from headaches and has been running albumin in the
urine.</p>

<h4>HIGH BLOOD-PRESSURE</h4>

<p>Blood-pressure is a term used to indicate the actual pressure
of the blood stream against the walls of the blood vessels.
The blood-pressure machine tells us the same story about our
circulatory mechanism, that a steam gauge does about a high-pressure
boiler (See <a href="#illus-006">Fig. 4</a>). The normal blood-pressure varies
according to the age of the patient. For instance, the normal
pressure of a young person, say up to twenty years of age,
runs from 100 to 120 millimeters of mercury; and then, as the
age advances, the blood-pressure increases in direct ratio; for
every two years additional age the blood-pressure increases
about one point&mdash;one millimeter.</p>

<p>The average pregnant woman starts in her pregnancy with
a blood-pressure of say, 125 millimeters, but as pressure symptoms
increase, and as constipation manifests itself, and as the
circulating fluids are further burdened with the toxins which
are eliminated from the child, the blood-pressure normally
increases to about 140 mm., and later, possibly to 150 mm.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
If the pressure goes no higher, we are not alarmed, for we
have come to recognize a blood-pressure of 140 as about the
normal pressure of the pregnant woman.</p>

<p>There are a number of factors which enter into the raising
of the blood-pressure. For instance, at any time during the
pregnancy, if the eliminative organs of the mother are doing
inefficient work, if she falls a victim to a torpid liver, diseased
kidneys, decreased skin elimination, or sluggish bowels, then,
with the added and extra excretions from the child, there is
superimposed upon the mother far more than the normal
amount of eliminative work&mdash;and then, because of improper
and incomplete elimination, the blood-pressure is increasingly
raised.</p>

<h4>ECLAMPSIA PREVENTED</h4>

<p>This whole subject can best be illustrated by relating a story,
the actual experience of Mrs. A. This patient came to the
office with a history of Bright's disease (albumin and casts
in the urine), and chronic appendicitis. While treating her
for the kidney condition, preparatory to an operation for the
removal of the troublesome appendix&mdash;in the very midst of
this treatment&mdash;she became pregnant, and great indeed was
our dismay. We entertained little hope of getting both the
mother and child safely through. Frequent examination of
urine was instituted, the albumin did not increase and the
blood-pressure remained at normal&mdash;about 124 mm. She
paid weekly or bi-weekly visits to the office and carefully followed
the regime outlined. She drank abundantly of water
and strictly followed the dietary prescribed. Weeks and
months passed uneventful, until we approached the last six
weeks of pregnancy, and then we found to our surprise one
day that the blood-pressure had made a sudden jump up to
175 mm., while the urine revealed the presence of numerous
casts and albumin&mdash;in the meantime the albumin had entirely
disappeared. There were also other urinary findings which
showed that the liver was not doing its share in the work of
burning up certain poisons.</p>

<p>In her home we began the following program: Every day<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
we had her placed in a bathtub of hot water, keeping cold cloths
upon her brow, face and neck, and then, by increasing the
temperature of the bath, we produced a very profuse perspiration.
She was taken out of this bath and wrapped in blankets,
thus continuing the sweat. All meat, baked beans, and such
foods as macaroni and other articles containing a high per cent
of protein were largely eliminated from her diet. At times
she did not even eat bread. Her chief diet was fruit, vegetables,
and simple salads, and yet the albumin and casts continued to
increase in the urine and the blood-pressure climbed up to 190
mm.</p>

<p>As we approached the last two weeks of pregnancy, this
little woman was taken to the hospital and systematic daily
treatment with sweating procedures was begun. Among other
things, she had a daily electric light bath. After each of these
baths she was wrapped in blankets and the sweating continued
for some time. Careful estimations of albumin were made daily
and the blood-pressure findings noted three times a day. During
the last week of pregnancy she lived on oranges and grapes.
Day by day she was watched until the eventful hour arrived.
She went into the delivery room and gave birth to a perfectly
normal child. The albumin and casts quickly cleared up, the
blood-pressure lowered, and today the little woman is a fond
mother of a beautiful baby boy.</p>

<p>It is hard to estimate what might have taken place had not
her elimination been stimulated. The blood-pressure was our
guide. Had the albumin (without casts) appeared in the latter
weeks of pregnancy with a blood-pressure of 140 or 150 mm.,
we would not have become excited, for the reason that in every
normal pregnancy there is often present a trace of albumin in
the latter weeks; but when the blood-pressure jumped to 170
or 190, then we knew that toxemia&mdash;eclampsia&mdash;convulsions&mdash;were
imminent. So we have in recent years, come to look
upon the blood-pressure as an exceedingly important factor&mdash;as
an infallible indicator of approaching trouble&mdash;as a red
signal light at the precipice or the point of danger; and it not
only warns us of the danger, but it tells us about how near
the boilers are to the bursting point. The glassy eye, the head<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>ache,
the full bounding pulse and the blurring of vision, are
all symptoms accompanying this high blood-pressure, so that
in these enlightened days no practitioner can count himself
worthy the name, or in any way fit to carry a pregnant woman
through the months of waiting, unless he sees, appreciates,
and understands the value of blood-pressure findings in
pregnancy.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>
<h2>PREPARATIONS FOR THE NATAL DAY</h2>
</div>

<p>Two months before baby is to arrive, the expectant mother
should pay particular attention to the conservation of her
strength. The woman who is compelled to leave her home for
the factory, the laundry, the office, or other place of employment,
should stop work during these last two or three months.
The active club woman should pass the burdens on to others,
and the woman of leisure should withdraw from active social
life with its varied obligations. During the final weeks of pregnancy,
the prospective mother needs the same hygienic care
regarding fresh air, exercise, diet, and water drinking, as outlined
in a former chapter.</p>

<h4>THE FINAL WEEKS</h4>

<p>As the gravid uterus rises higher in the abdomen, increased
pressure is exerted on the stomach, the lungs, and upon the
nerve centers of the back; and it is because of this situation,
that the duties and obligations of the prospective mother should
be reduced to a minimum, that she may feel at liberty to lie
down several times during the day on the porch or in a well-ventilated
room, in the midst of the best possible surroundings.
Sexual intercourse should be largely discontinued during the
last months of pregnancy.</p>

<p>I sometimes wish the prospective mothers in our dispensary
districts might have some of the care and the kind treatment
which is bestowed upon an ordinary prospective mother horse,
which at least enjoys a vacation from heavy labor, and whose
food is eaten with calm nerves and in the quietness of a clean
stall. While the state of the mother's mind does not materially
influence the child; nevertheless, the state of the mother's body,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
the weary over-worked muscles and nerves of hot, tired women,
bending over cook stoves, laundry tubs, or scrubbing floors, does
materially derange the mother's health and digestion, which in
turn, reflexly interferes with the growth and physical development
of her child. Extra strength is required for the day of
labor, and since the baby doubles its weight during the last
two months, the mother is living for two, and should, therefore,
avoid extreme fatigue, over tiring, and irksome labor during
these final weeks of watchful waiting.</p>

<h4>SELECTION OF THE HOME</h4>

<p>It may or may not be within the province of prospective
parents to rearrange, rebuild, or otherwise change the home.
Usually the size of the pocketbook, the bank account, or the
weekly pay envelope decide such things for us. The home may
be in the country or suburbs, with its wide expanse of lawns,
its hedges of shrubbery, and with its spacious rooms and
porches; or it may be a beautifully equipped, modern apartment
on the boulevard of a city, with its sun parlors, large back
porches, conveniently located near some well-kept city park,
or it may be one of those smaller but "snug as a bug in a rug"
apartments, in another part of the city, where usually there is
a sunny back porch; or again some of my readers may themselves
be, or their friends may be, in a darkened basement with
broken windows, illy ventilated rooms, with no porches, no
yards, no bright rays to be seen coming in through windows&mdash;and
yet into all of these varied homes there come little babies&mdash;sweet,
charming little babies, to be cared for, dressed, fed,
and reared. And we must now proceed to the subject of making
the most of what we have&mdash;to create out of what we have,
as best we can, that which ought to be.</p>

<h4>SANITARY PREMISES</h4>

<p>In both the country and city place, yards and alleys should
be cleaned up. Garbage&mdash;the great breeding place of flies&mdash;should
be removed or burned. The manure pile of the stable
or alley should also be properly covered and cared for. In
this way breeding places for flies are minimized and millions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
and billions of unhatched eggs are destroyed. In the large
cities, provision is made for the prompt disposal of garbage,
and laws are beginning to be enforced regarding the covering
and the weekly removal of manure, and thus in many of our
large cities flies are diminishing in numbers each year. Fly
campaigns and garbage campaigns are teaching us all to realize
the dangers of infection, contagion, and disease as a result of
filth; while through the schools, the children of even our foreign
tongued neighbors take home the spirit of "cleaning up week."
Even in the rural districts we hope for the dawning of the day
when filth, stagnant pools, open manure piles, and open privies,
will be as much feared as scorpions or smallpox.</p>

<h4>ENGAGING THE DOCTOR</h4>

<p>As suggested elsewhere, as soon as the expectant mother is
aware that she is pregnant, she should engage her physician.
And since these are days of specialists, he may or may not be
the regular family doctor. The husband and friends may be
consulted, but the final choice should be made by the prospective
mother herself. "The faith which casts out fear, the indefinable
sense of security which she feels in her chosen physician,
supports her through the hours of confinement." Twenty-four
hour specimens of urine should be saved and taken to the
physician twice each month and oftener during later months
of pregnancy. The chosen physician's instructions and suggestions
should be carried out and counsel should be sought
of him as to the place of confinement.</p>

<h4>THE PLACE OF CONFINEMENT</h4>

<p>There are a number of factors that enter into the selection
of the place of confinement. In the first place, if the home
be roomy, bathroom convenient, if the required preparation
of all necessities for the day of labor can be effected, and it is
further possible to prepare a suitable delivery-room at home
with ample facilities for emergencies and complications, and
you can persuade your physician to do it&mdash;then the best place
in the world for the mother to be confined is within the walls
of her own home. But such is the case in but one home out<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
of hundreds, and I regret that time and space will not allow me
to describe and portray the many untimely deaths that might
have been avoided if this or that supply had only been ready
at the moment of the unexpected complication of delivery.
Why should we needlessly risk the lives of prospective mothers,
when, in every up-to-date hospital delivery-room, all these life-saving
facilities are freely provided? Here in the modern
hospital, the mothers from small homes and apartments, the
mothers who live in stuffy basements, as well as those from
the average home in the average neighborhood, can come with
the assurance of receiving the best possible care and attention.
Every woman who can arrange or afford it, should plan to
avail herself of the benefits, comforts, quietness, and calm of a
well-equipped hospital and the surgical cleanliness and safety
of its aseptic delivery-room.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the mother of the basement home may have the
same clean, sterile dressings used upon her as does the mother
of the boulevard mansion. The maternity ward bed at $8.00
to $10.00 a week can be just as clean as the bed of the $40.00
a week room. The methods and procedures of the delivery-room
can be just as good in the case of the very poor woman
as in the case of the magnate's wife. In no way and for no
reason fear the hospital. It is the cleanest, safest, and by far
the cheapest way. The weekly amount paid includes the board
of the patient, the routine care, and all appliances and supplies
of every sort that will be used. Under no circumstances should
a midwife be engaged. Any reputable physician or any intellectual
minister will advise that. Let your choice be either the
hospital or the home; but always engage a physician, <i>never</i> a
midwife.</p>

<h4>THE NURSE</h4>

<p>After selecting the place of confinement, the question of the
nurse may next be considered. If it is to be the hospital, you need
give little further thought to the nurse, for your physician will
arrange for the nurse at the time you enter the hospital. She
will be a part of the complete service you may enjoy. You
will find her on duty as you, quietly resting in your room, awaken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
in the sweet satisfaction that at last it is all over&mdash;at last your
baby is here.</p>

<p>A competent nurse is a necessity, if the confinement takes
place in the home. She may be a visiting nurse, who, for a
small fee, will not only come on the day of labor, but will
make what is known as "post-partum calls" each day for ten
or twelve days. These are short calls, but are long enough to
clean up the mother and wash and dress the babe. She is not
supposed to prepare any meals or care for the home. Then
there is the practical nurse&mdash;women who have prepared themselves
along these lines of nursing, whose fees range from
$12.00 to $18.00 a week. If your physician recommends one
to you, you may know she is clean and dependable. The
trained nurse, who has graduated from a three years' course of
training, is prepared for every emergency, and will intelligently
work with the physician for the patient's welfare and comfort.
Her fees range from $25.00 to $35.00 a week.</p>

<p>Both the practical and the trained nurses are human beings,
and require rest and sleep the same as all other women do.
One nurse, after having faithfully remained at her post of duty
some sixty hours reminded the husband and sister of the
patient that she must now have five hours of unbroken rest and
they replied in a most surprised manner, "Why we are paying
you $30.00 a week, and besides, we understood you were a
<i>trained</i> nurse."</p>

<p>The physician usually makes arrangement with the family
for competent relief for the nurse. She should have at least
one to two hours of each day for an airing, and six hours out
of the twenty-four for sleep.</p>

<h4>PREPARATIONS FOR A HOME DELIVERY</h4>

<p>The supplies should all be in the home and ready, as the
seventh month of pregnancy draws near. In the first place,
select the drawer or closet shelf where the supplies are to
remain, untouched, until your physician orders them brought
out. The supplies requiring special preparation and sterilization
are:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span></p>

<h4>THE PREPARATION OF THE SUPPLIES</h4>

<p>1. <i>The sanitary pad</i> is used to absorb the lochia after confinement,
and needs to be changed many times during the day
and night; fully five or six dozen will be required. They are
usually made from cotton batting and a generous layer of
absorbent cotton. If made entirely from absorbent cotton they
mat down into a rope-like condition. They are four and one-half
to five inches wide and ten inches long. The sterile cheesecloth
is cut large enough to wrap around the cotton filling and
extends at both ends three inches, by which it is fastened<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
to the abdominal binder. With a dozen or fifteen in each
package these vulva pads are wrapped loosely in pieces of old
sheets and pinned securely and marked plainly on the outside.</p>

<p>2. <i>Delivery pads.</i> These pads should be thirty-six inches
square and about five inches thick, three or four inches of
which may be the cotton batting and the remainder absorbent
cotton. Three of these are needed. Each should be folded,
wrapped in a piece of cloth and likewise marked.</p>

<p>3. <i>Gauze squares.</i> Five dozen gauze squares about four
inches in size may be cut, wrapped and marked. These are
needed for the nipples, baby's eyes, etc.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 5. Breast Binder.</span>
</div>

<p>4. <i>Cotton pledgets.</i> These are cotton balls, made as you
would a light biscuit with the twist of the cotton to hold it in
shape. They should be about the size of the bottom of a teacup.
These are thrown in a couple of pillow slips and wrapped
and marked.</p>

<p>5. <i>The Bobbin.</i> Cut the bobbin or tape into four nine-inch
lengths and wrap and mark.</p>

<p>6. The <i>tooth picks</i> are left in the original package and do
not require sterilization.</p>

<p>7. <i>Sterilization.</i> Before steaming and baking, wrap each
bundle in another wrapping of cloth and pin again securely. Mark
each package plainly in large letters or initials. These packages
may be sent to the hospital for sterilization in the autoclave<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
or they may be steamed for one hour in the large wash boiler,
by placing them loosely into a hammock-like arrangement made
by suspending a firm piece of muslin from one handle of the
boiler to the other. The center of the hammock should come
to within five inches of the bottom of the boiler which contains
three inches of boiling water. The cover of the boiler
is now securely weighed down and the water boils hard for one
hour, at the end of which time they are removed and placed in
a warm oven to dry out. The outer wrapping may be slightly
tinged with brown by this baking. After a thorough drying
they are allowed to remain in the same wrappings into which
they were first placed and put away in a clean drawer awaiting
the "Natal Day."</p>

<h4>REQUISITES FOR THE HOSPITAL</h4>

<p>Each hospital has its own methods and regulations for caring
for obstetrical patients and it is well for the expectant mother
to visit the obstetrical section, the delivery-room and the baby's
room, that she may personally know more about the place where
she is to spend from ten days to two weeks. Here she may
ascertain from the superintendent just what she will need to
bring for the baby. Many of the hospitals furnish all the
clothes needed for the baby while in the hospital; in such instances,
the hospital also launders them. Other hospitals require
the baby's clothes to be brought in, in which case the mother
looks after the laundry. The mother always takes her toilet
articles, a warm bed jacket with long sleeves, several night
dresses and a large loose kimono or wrapper to wear to the
roof garden or porch in the wheel chair. Warm bedroom
slippers and a scarf for the head completes the outfit.</p>

<h4>BABY'S NECESSITIES</h4>

<p>Baby's basket on the day of confinement should contain:</p>

<h4>THE CONFINEMENT ROOM</h4>

<p>By special preparation, the ordinary bedroom may be fashioned
into a delivery-room. Carpets, hangings and upholstered
furniture must be removed. Clean walls, clean floors, and a
scrupulously clean bed must be maintained throughout the
puerperium. Bathroom, and if possible, a porch should be
near by. In the wealthy home, a bedroom, bathroom and the
nursery adjoining is ideal; but I find that real life is always
filled with anything but the ideal.</p>

<p>The dispensary doctor is compelled to depend upon clean
newspapers to cover everything in the room he finds his
patient in. The only sterile things he uses he brings with him,
and should he have to spend the night, the floor is his only
bed. A student who was in my service told me that there was
not one article in the entire home, which consisted of but one
room, that could be used for the baby. He wrapped his own
coat about it and laid it carefully in a market basket and
placed it on the floor at the side of the pallet on which the
mother lay and by the aid of a nearby telephone secured
clothes from the dispensary for the babe.</p>

<p>Always select the best room in the house for a home confinement.
If the parlor is the one sunny room, take it; remove
all draperies, carpet, etc., and make it as near surgically clean
as possible. While sunshine is desirable, ample shades must
be supplied, as the eyes of both mother and babe must be
protected.</p>

<h4>THE BED</h4>

<p>A three-quarter bed is more desirable than a double bed.
If it is low, four-inch blocks should be placed under each leg,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
the casters having been removed to prevent slipping. The
bed should be so placed that it can be reached from either
side by the nurse and physician. The mattress may be reenforced
by the placing of a board under it if there is a tendency
to sag in the middle. Over this mattress is securely pinned the
strip of rubber sheeting or table oilcloth. A clean sheet covers
mattress and rubber cloth and at the spot where the hips are
to lie may be placed the large sterile pad to absorb the escaping
fluids. The floor about the bed is protected by newspapers or
oilcloth. Good lighting should always be provided. Much
trouble and possible infection may be avoided by clean bedding,
plenty of clean dressings, boiled water, rubber gloves, and
clean hands.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>
<h2>THE DAY OF LABOR</h2>
</div>

<p>As the two hundred and seventy-three days come to a close,
our expectant mother approaches the day of labor with
joy and gladness. The long, long waiting days so full of
varied experiences, so full of the consciousness that she, the
waiting mother, is to bring into the world a being which may
have so many possibilities&mdash;well, even the anticipated pangs
of approaching labor are welcomed as marking the close of the
long vigil. These days have brought many unpleasant symptoms,
they have been days of tears and smiles, of clouds and sunshine.</p>

<h4>THE TIME OF WAITING</h4>

<p>The prospective mother has thought many times, "Will my
baby ever come?" But nature is very faithful, prompt, and
resourceful. She ushers in this harvest time under great stress
and strain, for actual labor is before us&mdash;downright, hard
labor&mdash;just about the hardest work that womankind ever
experiences&mdash;and, as a rule, she needs but little help&mdash;good
direction as to the proper method of work and the economical
expenditure of energy. In the case of the average mother this
is about all that is needed, and if these suggestions come from
a wise and sympathetic physician&mdash;one who understands and
appreciates asepsis&mdash;she may count herself as fortunately
situated for the oncoming ordeal.</p>

<p>In the days of our grandmothers it was almost the exception
rather than the rule to escape "child-bed fever," "milk leg,"
etc.; but in these enlightened days of asepsis, rubber gloves,
and the various antiseptics, puerperal infection is the exception,
while a normal puerperium is the rule; and this work of pre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>vention
lies in the scrupulous care taken by anyone and everyone
concerned in any way with the events of the day of labor.</p>

<p>On this day of labor, the mother, who has gone through
the long tedious days of waiting, should see to it that nothing
unclean&mdash;hands, sponges, forcep, water, cloth&mdash;is allowed
to touch her. Above all things do not employ a physician who
has earned the reputation of being a "dirty doctor." Puerperal
infection is almost wholly a preventable disease and every
patient has a right to insist upon protection against it.</p>

<p>In a former chapter will be found a detailed description of the
"delivery bed." Beside this bed, or near by, are to be found
the rack on which are airing the necessary garments for the
baby's reception&mdash;the receiving blanket and other requisites
for the first bath&mdash;together with numerous other articles essential
to safety and comfort.</p>

<p>There should be an easy chair in the room for the mother
to rest in between her walking excursions during the first
stages of labor. The sterilized pads and necessary articles mentioned
in an earlier chapter are, of course, close at hand.</p>

<h4>FIRST SYMPTOMS OF LABOR</h4>

<p>Regular, cramp-like pains in the lower portion of the abdomen
which are frequently mistaken for intestinal colic, often beginning
in the lower part of the back, and extending to the front
and down the thigh, are often the first symptoms of the approaching
event. With each cramp or pain the abdomen gets
very hard and as the pain passes away the abdomen again assumes
its normal condition. These regular cramp-like pains
are the result of the early dilation of the cervix&mdash;the first
opening of the door to the uterine room which has housed our
little citizen through the developmental stages of embryonic
life&mdash;and as a result of this stretching and dilating there soon
appears that special blood-tinged mucus flow commonly known
as "the show."</p>

<h4>THE PRELIMINARY BATH</h4>

<p>At this time a very thorough-going colonic flushing should
be administered. The patient takes the "knee-chest" position,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
or the "lying-down" position, and there should flow into the
lower bowel three pints of soapy water; this should be retained
for a few moments; and after its expulsion, a short, plain
water injection should be given. Now follows the preliminary
general bath.</p>

<p>Just prior to the bath, the pubic hair should be clipped closely,
or better shaved. Then should follow a thorough soap wash,
with patient standing up in the tub, using plenty of soap, applied
with a shampoo brush or rough turkish mit. The rinsing now
takes place by either a shower or pail pour. <i>Do not sit down
in the tub.</i> This is a rule that must not be broken, because of
the danger of infection in those cases where the bag of waters
may have broken early in the labor.</p>

<p>A weak antiseptic solution, prepared by putting two small
antiseptic tablets into one pint and a half of warm water, is
now applied to the body from the breasts to the knee. Put
on a freshly laundered gown, clean stockings and wrapper. The
head should be cleansed and hair braided in two braids.</p>

<h4>THE PROGRESS OF LABOR</h4>

<p>If all the mothers who read this volume could bear children
with the comfort Mrs. C. does, I should be happy, indeed.</p>

<p>At four o'clock one morning a very much excited father
telephoned me, "Hurry, quick, Doctor, it's almost here." It
was well that we did hurry, for the first sign the little mother
had was the deluge of the waters&mdash;at this point the husband
ran to telephone for the doctor&mdash;no more pains for thirty-eight
minutes (just as we entered the door) and the baby
was there. But such is not usually the case, nor will it be, as labor
usually progresses along the lines of conscious dilating pains,
occurring at intervals twenty minutes apart at first, later drawing
nearer together until they are three to five minutes apart.
This "first stage of labor" lasts from one to fifteen hours&mdash;during
which time the tiny door to the uterine room which
was originally about one-eighth of an inch open&mdash;dilates sufficiently
to allow the passage of the head, shoulders and body
of the fully developed child.</p>

<p>About this time the bag of waters usually bursts, and, as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
rule, this marks the beginning of the "second stage of labor."
The amount of water passed varies in amount. Should the
rupture take place before the door is fully open, then labor
proceeds with difficulty and the condition is known as "dry
labor."</p>

<p>The head after proper rotation now begins the descent;
and here the pains begin to change from the sharp, lancinating,
cramp-like pains which begin in the back and move around to
the front, to those of the "bearing down" variety, while at the
same time there begins to appear the bulging at the perineum,
which means that the head is about to be born. At this time
great stress is brought to bear upon the perineum and often,
in spite of anything that can be done to prevent it, the perineum
is more or less lacerated.</p>

<p>As soon as the baby is born the "second stage of labor"
has passed and within thirty to fifty minutes the close of the
third stage of labor is marked by the passage of the placenta
or "afterbirth."</p>

<h4>FALSE LABOR PAINS</h4>

<p>Sometimes, as long as two weeks before the birth of the
child, certain irregular, heavy, cramp-like pains occur in the
abdomen and back. For a half-dozen pains they may show
some signs of regularity; but they usually die down only to
start up again at irregular intervals. These are known as
"false pains."</p>

<p>When the pains begin to take on regularity and gradually
grow heavier and it is near the appointed time for the labor,
the patient should prepare to start for the hospital; or, if it is
to be a home delivery, the physician should be called. As
noted above, the first subjective symptom may be the rupture
of the bag of waters, and it is imperative to prepare at once
for the labor. It is far better to spend the day at the hospital,
or even two days waiting, rather than to run the risk of giving
birth to the child in a taxicab or street car; or, in the event
of a home labor, to have the child born before the doctor
arrives.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span></p>

<h4>WHAT TO DO IN THE ABSENCE OF A DOCTOR</h4>

<p>It is often the case that when we need our physician the
most, he is busy with another patient and cannot come, or
perhaps an automobile accident detains the man of the hour.
The hospital delivery always possesses this advantage over the
home&mdash;physicians are always on hand. We deem it wise to
relate in detail the method of procedure during the rapid birth
of a child; that the husband or nurse may give intelligent
and clean service.</p>

<p>After the patient has been given the enema and has been
shaved and the bath has been administered as previously
directed, the helper most vigorously "scrubs up." There are
three distinct phases to the "scrubbing up": First, the three-minute
scrubbing of the hands and forearms with a clean brush
and green soap; to be followed by, second, the trimming and
cleaning of the finger nails, for it is here, under the nails, that
the micro-organism lives and thrives that causes child-bed
fever or septicemia; and, third, the final five-minute scrubbing
of the fingers, hands, and forearms. An ordinary towel is not
used to dry the well-cleansed hands, but they are now dipped
in alcohol and allowed to dry in the air.</p>

<p>And now if the pains are returning every three to five minutes
or if the bag of waters has broken, the patient should go to
bed. She will lie down on her back with the knees drawn up
and spread apart. The patient, having had the cleansing bath,
is now washed with the disinfectant bath (2 antiseptic tablets
to 1&frac12; pints of water), from the breasts to the knees. Another
member of the family takes the outer wrappings off the
sterilized delivery pad and the "clean" helper places the sterile
delivery pad under the expectant mother, who is directed to
"bear down" when her pains come. She may be supported
during these pains by pulling on a sheet that has been fastened
to the foot of the bed.</p>

<p>The <i>clean</i>, helper then sits by her constantly until the baby
is born but under no circumstances should touch her until after
the head appears. Immediately after the birth of the head, the
shoulders usually follow with the next pain, which ought to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
occur within two or three minutes. Occasionally the face turns
blue, in such an instance, the mother is directed to strain
vigorously and presses down heavily on the abdomen with
both her hands, this usually hurries matters materially, and the
body of the child follows quickly. The baby should cry at
once. If the child does not show signs of life, quick, brisk
slapping on the back usually brings relief. During the birth
of the head it is imperative that, in the event of liquid passing
at the same time, no water or blood be sucked into the mouth
by the baby. Great care must be exercised in this matter.
Should the baby remain blue, lay it quickly upon its right side
near the mother, and after the pulse of the cord has stopped
beating the clean helper ties the cord twice, two inches from
the child and again two inches from this tying toward the
mother, and then the cord is cut between the two tyings with
scissors that have been boiled twenty minutes.</p>

<p>Should there be more difficulty with the breathing of the
new born child, if slapping it on the back brings no relief, its
back (with face well protected) may be dipped first in good
warm water, then cold, again in the warm, again in the cold&mdash;this
seldom fails. The child should then be kept very warm,
lying on its right side.</p>

<h4>CARE OF THE MOTHER</h4>

<p>All this time, a member of the family has been firmly grasping
the mother's abdomen, and within an hour the afterbirth
passes out through the birth canal. If the physician has not
yet arrived, all dressings, the pad, the afterbirth, must all be
saved for his inspection.</p>

<p>The inside of the thighs and the region about the vagina is
now washed with bichloride solution, the soiled delivery pad
removed, a clean delivery pad is placed under her; an abdominal
binder is applied and two sterile vulva pads are placed
between the legs, and hot water bottles are put to her feet, as
usually at this stage there is a slight tendency toward chilliness.
She should now settle down for rest. Fresh air should be admitted
into the room. There may be some hemorrhage, and
if it is excessive, grasp the lower abdomen and begin to knead<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
it until you distinctly feel a change in the uterus from the soft
mass to a hard ball about the size of a large grape fruit; thus
contraction has been brought about which causes the hemorrhage
to decrease. If the doctor has not yet arrived put the
baby to the breast, and place an ice bag for ten or fifteen
minutes on the abdomen just over the uterus. Should there
be lacerations, the doctor will attend to their repair when he
comes. One teaspoonful of the fluid extract of ergot is usually
given at this time, if possible get in touch with the physician
before it is administered.</p>

<h4>CARE OF THE BABY</h4>

<p>After the mother is comfortable, your attention is directed
to the baby; the condition of the cord is noted; should it be
bleeding, do not disturb the tying, but tie again, more tightly
just below the former tying, and with the long ends of the
tape, tie on a sterile gauze sponge or a piece of clean untouched
medicated cotton, thus efficiently protecting the severed end of
the cord. No further dressing is needed until the doctor
arrives.</p>

<p>Grave disorders have arisen from infection through the
freshly cut umbilical cord.</p>

<p>Should the doctor be longer delayed, one drop of twenty
per cent argyrol should be dropped in each of the infant's
eyes and separate pieces of cotton should be used for each
eye to wipe the surplus medicine away.</p>

<p>This application must not be long neglected, for a very large
per cent of all the blindness in this world might have been
avoided had this medicine been placed in each eye soon after
birth.</p>

<p>The warmed albolene is now swabbed over the entire body
of the infant (this is done with a piece of cotton), the arm
pits, the groins, behind the ears, between the thighs, the bend
of the elbow, etc, must all receive the albolene swabbing. In
a few minutes, this is gently rubbed off with a piece of gauze
or an old soft towel, and the baby comes forth as clean and as
smooth as a lily and as sweet as a rose.</p>

<p>The garments are now placed on the child&mdash;first the band,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
then shirt, diaper, stockings, flannel skirt, and outing flannel
gown&mdash;and it is put to rest after the administration of one
teaspoonful of cooled, boiled water. In six to eight hours
it will be put to the breast.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX</h2>
<h2>TWILIGHT SLEEP AND PAINLESS LABOR</h2>
</div>

<p>In recent years much has appeared in both the popular magazines
and the medical press concerning the so-called "twilight
sleep" and other methods of producing "painless childbirth."
Many of these popular articles in the lay press cannot
be regarded in any other light than as being in bad taste and
wholly unfortunate in their method and manner of presenting
the subject; nevertheless, these writings have served to arouse
such a general public interest in the subject of obstetric
anesthetics, that we deem it advisable to devote two chapters
to the brief and concise consideration of the subjects of pain
and anesthetics in relation to the day of labor.</p>

<h4>THE PAIN OF LABOR</h4>

<p>First, let us briefly consider the question of pain in connection
with childbirth. Many women&mdash;normal, natural, and
healthy women&mdash;suffer but comparatively little in giving birth
to an average-sized baby during an average and uncomplicated
labor. Like the Indian squaw, they suffer a minimum of pain
at childbirth&mdash;at least this is largely true after the birth of
the first baby; and so there is little need of discussing any sort
of anesthesia for this group of fortunate women; for at most,
all that would ever be employed in the nature of an anesthetic
in such cases, would be a trifle of chloroform to take the edge
off the suffering at the height or conclusion of labor.</p>

<p>But the vast majority of American mothers do not belong to
this fortunate and normal class of women who suffer so little
during childbirth; they rather belong to that large and growing
class of women who have dressed wrong; who have lived unhealthful
and sometimes indolent lives; who are more or less<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
physically and temperamentally unfitted to pass through the
experiences of pregnancy and the trials of labor.</p>

<p>The average American woman shrinks from the thought and
prospect of suffering pain; she is quite intolerant with the idea
of undergoing even the few brief moments of physical suffering
attendant upon childbirth. She refuses to contemplate the
day of labor in any other light than that which insures her
against all possible pain and other physical suffering.</p>

<p>And it is just this unnatural and abnormal fear of labor-pains&mdash;this
unwomanly dread of the slightest degree of
physical suffering&mdash;that has indirectly led up to so much discussion
regarding the employment of "twilight sleep" and
other forms of obstetric anesthesia.</p>

<p>While the authors recognize the great blessing of anesthesia
to the woman in labor&mdash;and almost unfailingly make use of
it in some form&mdash;nevertheless, we also recognize that it would
be a fine form of mental discipline and mighty good moral
gymnastics, if a great many self-centered and pampered women
would "spunk right up" and face the ordeal of labor with
natural courage and normal fortitude. It would be "the making
of them," it would make new women out of them, it would
start them out on the road to real living. At the same time
we do not mean to advocate that women should suffer unnecessary
pain in childbirth any more than we allow them to suffer
in connection with surgery.</p>

<h4>PREPARATION FOR LABOR</h4>

<p>While so much is being written about "twilight sleep" and
"painless labor," it might be well to remind the American
mother that much can be done to lessen the sufferings of the
day of labor by one's method of living prior to the confinement.</p>

<p>We believe that child-bearing is a perfectly normal physical
function for a healthy and normal woman&mdash;that it is even essential
to her complete physical health, mental happiness, and
moral well-being. Theoretically, child-bearing ought to be but
little more painful than the functionating of numerous other
vital organs&mdash;stomach, heart, bladder, bowels, etc.&mdash;and, in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>deed,
it is not in the case of certain savage tribes and other
aboriginal people, such as our own North American Indian.</p>

<p>But we must face the facts. The average American woman
does suffer at childbirth; and she suffers more than we are
disposed to allow her, or more than she, as a general rule, is
willing to suffer. So, while we discuss appropriate methods
of lessening the pain of labor and the pangs of childbirth by
the scientific use of anesthetics, let us also call attention to
certain things which may aid in decreasing the amount of pain
which may reasonably be expected to attend child bearing.</p>

<p>To assist in bringing about this preparation for decreased
pain at childbirth, mothers should teach their daughters how
to develop, strengthen, and preserve their physical, mental, and
moral resistance. The young mother should be taught by both
her mother and her physician how to dress, how to work, and
how to eat. Every care should be given to the hygiene of
pregnancy and labor.</p>

<p>The expectant mother should have plenty of fruits and fruit
juices, and if not physically well endowed to give birth to a
large babe, she should have her diet restricted in meat, bread
and milk, as well as the cereals. Overeating during pregnancy
should be carefully guarded against, as emphasized in
an earlier chapter. Deformities of the pelvis, etc., should rule
out a consideration of pregnancy.</p>

<p>While artificial painless childbirth by means of "twilight
sleep" and other similar methods all have their place; nevertheless,
these procedures should not lead to the neglect of those
natural methods and preventive practices which aid in preparing
the normal expectant mother for nature's relatively
painless labor. When so much anesthesia has to be used in a
normal labor, it cannot but strongly suggest that both patient
and physician have neglected those common but efficient
methods which contribute indirectly to lessening the pangs of
child bearing.</p>

<h4>WHAT IS TWILIGHT SLEEP?</h4>

<p>"Twilight sleep" is a recent term which has become associated
in the public mind with "painless labor." The reader<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
should understand that "twilight sleep" is not a new method
of obstetric anesthesia. While this method of inducing
"painless labor" has been brought prominently before the
public mind in recent years by much discussion and by numerous
magazine articles&mdash;being often presented in such a way as
sometimes to lead the uninstructed layman to infer that a new
method of obstetric anesthesia had just been discovered&mdash;it
has, nevertheless, been known and more or less used since 1903.
Later known as the "Freiburg Method," and as the "Dammerschlaf"
of Gauss, and still later popularized as "twilight
sleep," this "scopolamin-morphin" method of obstetric
anesthesia, has gained wide attention and acquired many zealous
advocates.</p>

<p>"Twilight sleep" is, therefore, nothing new&mdash;it is simply
a revival of the old combination of <i>scopolamin</i> and <i>morphin</i>
anesthesia. While many different methods of administering
"twilight sleep" have been devised, the following general plan
will serve to inform the reader sufficiently regarding the technic
of this much-talked-of procedure.</p>

<p>The scopolamin must always be fresh, although different
forms of the drug are used. It tends quickly to decompose&mdash;forming
a toxic by-product&mdash;and, according to some authorities,
this decomposed scopolamin is responsible for many undesirable
results which have attended some cases of "twilight
sleep." Various forms of morphin are also used, as also is
narcophin.</p>

<h4>TECHNIC OF "TWILIGHT SLEEP"</h4>

<p>The "twilight-sleep" injections are not started until the
patient is in the stage of active labor. The initial injection
consists of the proper dose of scopolamin and morphin (or
some of their derivatives), while the patient's pupils, pulse, and
respiration are carefully noted, as also are the character of
the uterine contractions and the character of the fetal heart
action.</p>

<p>Usually within an hour, a second dose of scopolamin is given,
while the application of so-called "memory tests" serves to
indicate whether it is advisable to administer additional injec<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>tions.
Some leading advocates of this method claim that the
majority of the unfavorable results attendant upon "twilight
sleep" are the direct result of failure to control the dosage
of the drug by these "memory tests;" and they call attention
to the large percentage of "painlessness" as proof of probable
overdosing. If the patient's memory is clear and she is not
yet under the influence of the drug, a third dose is soon given.
If, however, the patient is in a state of amnesia (lack of
memory), this third injection is not commonly given until
about one hour after the second injection. The amount of
amnesia present is used as a guide for repeated injections at
intervals of one to one and a half hours. As a rule, the morphin
is not repeated.</p>

<p>It must be evident that the success of such a method of
anesthesia must depend entirely upon thoroughgoing personal
supervision of the individual patient by a properly trained
and experienced physician; and it is for just these reasons
that "twilight sleep" is destined to remain largely a hospital
procedure for a long time to come.</p>

<p>Experience has shown that those cases of "twilight sleep"
that are not under the influence of scopolamin over five or six
hours do vastly better than those under a longer time. When
employed too long before labor this method seems to favor
inertia and thus tends to increase the number of forceps
deliveries.</p>

<p>The number of injections may run from one to a dozen or
more, and patients have come through without accident with
fifteen or more doses, running over a period of twenty-four
hours.</p>

<h4>THE CLAIMS OF "TWILIGHT SLEEP"</h4>

<p>While "twilight sleep" as a method of anesthesia is not altogether
new, many of the claims made for it by recent advocates
are more or less new; and, to enable the reader clearly to comprehend
both the advantages and disadvantages of this method,
both the favorable and unfavorable facts and contentions will
be summarized in this connection. The favorable claims made
for "twilight sleep" are:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span></p>

<p>1. That eighty to ninety per cent of all women who use this
method can be carried through a practically painless labor.</p>

<p>2. That there is practically no danger to the mother (some
degree of danger to the child is admitted by most of its champions)
other than those commonly attendant on the older and
better known methods in general use.</p>

<p>3. That "twilight sleep," being almost exclusively a hospital
procedure, would result in more women going to the hospital
for their confinement&mdash;if it were used more; and would, therefore,
tend to bring about more careful supervision and individual
care on the part of the attending obstetrician.</p>

<p>4. That by lessening the dread of labor and the fear of
painful childbirth, there will probably occur an increase in the
birth rate of the so-called "higher classes of society"&mdash;the
social circles which now show the lowest birth rates.</p>

<p>5. That it is of special value in the cases of certain neurotic
women and those of low vital resistance; especially those patients
suffering from certain forms of heart, respiratory, kidney, and
other organic diseases.</p>

<p>6. Some authorities maintain that "twilight sleep" is of
value even in threatened eclampsia, although they admit it tends
to produce a rise in blood-pressure.</p>

<p>7. It is supposed to shorten the first stage of labor&mdash;by
facilitating the dilation of the cervix&mdash;owing to the painless
stretching; although the majority of its special advocates admit
that it lengthens the second stage of labor, during which the
patient must be very closely watched.</p>

<p>8. That even in those cases where the sense of pain is not
entirely destroyed, the patient seems to possess little or no
subsequent memory of any physical suffering or other disagreeable
sensations.</p>

<p>9. That the method is of special value in sensitive, high-strung,
nervous women of the "higher classes," who so habitually
shun the rigors of child bearing&mdash;especially in the instance
of their first child.</p>

<p>10. That the action of scopolamin is chiefly upon the central
nervous system&mdash;the cerebrum&mdash;that it diminishes the perception
of pain without apparently decreasing the contractile<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
power of the uterus; labor may, therefore, proceed with little
or no interruption, while the patient is quite oblivious to the
accompanying pains.</p>

<p>11. That the physical and nervous exhaustion is quite entirely
eliminated&mdash;especially in the case of the first labor&mdash;that
patients who have had this method of anesthesia appear
refreshed and quite themselves even the first day after labor.</p>

<p>12. That there is decidedly less "trauma" (appreciable
injury) to the nervous system and therefore less "shock;" and
that all this saving of nervous strain tends greatly to hasten
convalescence.</p>

<p>13. And, finally, that "twilight sleep" does not interfere
with the carrying out of any other therapeutic measures which
may be deemed necessary for a successful termination of the
labor.</p>

<h4>DANGERS OF TWILIGHT SLEEP</h4>

<p>While we are recounting the real and supposed advantages
of "twilight sleep"&mdash;especially in certain selected cases&mdash;it
will be wise to pause long enough to give the same careful
consideration to the known and reputed dangers and drawbacks
which are thought to attend this method of anesthesia in connection
with labor cases.</p>

<p>We desire to state that these expressions, both for and
against "twilight sleep," are not merely representative of our
own experience and attitude; but that they also represent, as
far as we are able to judge at the time of this writing, the
consensus of opinion on the part of the most reliable and
experienced observers and practitioners who have used and
studied this method in both this country and Europe. The
dangers and difficulties of "twilight sleep" may be summarized
as follows:</p>

<p>1. That this method tends to weaken the mental resistance
of many women; to lessen their natural courage and to decrease
that commendable fortitude which is such a valuable feature
of the character endowment of the normal woman.</p>

<p>2. That "twilight sleep" is essentially a hospital method and
is, therefore, inaccessible to the vast majority of women belong<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>ing
to the middle and lower classes of society, as well as to
those women who live in rural communities.</p>

<p>3. That in fifteen or twenty per cent, the method fails to
produce the desired results&mdash;at least, when administered in
amounts which are deemed safe.</p>

<p>4. That this method does decrease the baby's chances of
living; that the second stage of labor is definitely prolonged;
that from ten to fifteen per cent of the babies are sufficiently
under the influence of the anesthesia when born as to be unable
to breathe or cry without artificial stimulus.</p>

<p>5. That it is a method requiring special training and experience;
that it will be many years before the average practitioner
will become proficient in its use; and that the older
methods are probably far safer for the average physician.</p>

<p>6. That the method requires more care in its administration
than can be expected outside of the hospital in order to avoid
the dangers of fetal asphyxiation&mdash;which danger has led
not a few obstetricians to abandon it.</p>

<p>7. That a satisfactory technic is almost impossible of development;
that every patient must be individualized; that the
chief dangers are connected with the over dosage of morphin;
that the method is not adaptable to the general practice of the
average doctor.</p>

<p>8. That by prolonging the second stage of labor and by
sometimes giving too much morphin, the number of forceps
deliveries is greatly increased, with their attendant and increased
dangers to both mother and child.</p>

<p>9. That the prospects of passing through labor which may be
rendered painless by artificial methods, tends to produce an attitude
of carelessness and indifference towards those natural
methods of living and other hygienic practices which so greatly
contribute to naturally painless confinements.</p>

<p>10. That this method as sometimes practiced greatly increases
the dangers of a general anesthetic, if such should be found
necessary later on during the labor.</p>

<p>11. That "twilight sleep" is contra-indicated (should not
be used) in the following conditions: primary inertia (abnormally
delayed and slow labor); expected short labor&mdash;especially<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
in women who have already borne children; when the
fetal head is known to be large and the mother's pelvis small;
placenta praevia (abnormal placental attachment); accidental
hemorrhage; absent or doubtful fetal heart beat; when labor
is already far advanced; and in threatened convulsions and
eclampsia.</p>

<h4>CONCLUSIONS REGARDING TWILIGHT SLEEP</h4>

<p>Having presented the evidence both for and against "twilight
sleep," it may be of assistance to the lay reader to have
placed before her the personal conclusions and working opinions
of the authors. We, therefore, undertake to summarize our
present attitude and outline our practice as follows:</p>

<p>1. "Twilight sleep" as a method of obstetric anesthesia in
certain selected cases and in well-equipped hospitals, and in the
hands of careful and experienced practitioners, has demonstrated
that it is a scientific reality&mdash;and has probably come
to stay&mdash;at least until better and safer methods of affecting a
relatively painless confinement are discovered; although we are
compelled to state that it is not the panacea the lay press has
led many of our patients to believe. (That we believe a much
better and safer method has been devised, the next chapter
will fully disclose.)</p>

<p>2. We do not expect this method ever to become general
in its use; we do not look for a chain of special "twilight hospitals"
to stretch across the continent and then to overrun the
country. We expect much of the recent forced enthusiasm to
die down, while scopolamin-morphin anesthesia takes it proper
place among other scientific methods of alleviating the pangs
of labor.</p>

<p>3. We know that standard and fresh solutions&mdash;as already
noted&mdash;are absolutely essential for the success of this method.</p>

<p>4. We are certain that no routine method or technic can
be developed. Each patient must be individualized. The method
does not consist in injecting scopolamin every so often. The
patient's mental and physical condition&mdash;as also that of the
unborn child&mdash;must control the administration of "twilight
sleep."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span></p>

<p>5. The patient must be in a quiet and partially darkened
room. She must not be disturbed; while the physician, or a
competent trained nurse, must be in constant attendance.
well-appointed hospital, there is no real reason why it cannot
be fairly well carried out in a well-regulated private home,
provided the necessary preparations have been made, a trained
nurse is present, and provided, further, that the physician is
willing to remain in the home with the patient the length of
time required properly to supervise the treatment.</p>

<p>6. While this method of treatment is best carried out in the
well-appointed hospital, there is no real reason why it cannot be
fairly well carried out in a well-regulated private home, provided the
necessary preparations have been made, a trained nurse is present, and
provided, further, that the physician is willing to remain in the home
with the patient the length of time required properly to supervise the
treatment.</p>

<p>7. Even when the treatment is not instituted early in labor,
it can, in certain selected and appropriate cases, be utilized even
in the second stage of labor&mdash;thus saving these special cases
much unnecessary pain; in fact, some authorities regard it as
a valuable adjunct in the management of "borderland contractions"
as it allows the patient a full test of labor.</p>

<p>8. In our opinion, this method has little effect on the first
stage of labor if properly administered; but it does undoubtedly
prolong and tend to complicate the second stage; in fact, we
are coming to look upon "twilight sleep" as being more distinctly
a first stage procedure; that it bears the same relation
to the first stage of labor that chloroform bears to the second
stage&mdash;relieving the pain but not stopping the progress of labor.</p>

<p>9. That when safe amounts of the drug are used the pain
is greatly lessened in all cases&mdash;the subsequent memory of pain
is absent in the majority of the patients&mdash;but the labor is not
always entirely painless as is popularly supposed.</p>

<p>10. We do not believe that this method when properly administered
increases the number of forceps deliveries&mdash;at least
not in the case of high forceps operations. It undoubtedly does
cover up the symptoms of a threatened rupture of the uterus,
and thus increases danger from that source; nevertheless it
may be safely stated that this method does not in any way
greatly interfere with any other measures which might be
found necessary to institute in order to bring about a successful
termination of the labor.</p>

<p>11. The baby's heart beat must be carefully and constantly
watched; sudden slowing means that the treatment must be discontinued<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
and the child delivered as soon as possible; even then,
difficulty may be experienced in getting the baby's breathing
started after it is born. In the vast majority of cases where the
baby does not cry or breathe at birth, the usual methods employed
in such cases serve quickly to establish normal respiration,
and the baby seems to be but little the worse for the
experience.</p>

<p>12. While altogether too much has been claimed for "twilight
sleep" at the same time many false fears have also been
suggested, among which may be mentioned the fear of the mother
losing her mind after the treatment; the undue fear of asphyxiation
on the part of the baby; the fear of post-partum hemorrhage;
and the fear that it will lessen the milk supply. We cannot
deny that the child's dangers are often increased; but in other
respects, this method (in properly selected cases) presents
little more to worry us than the older methods of anesthesia.</p>

<p>13. We are inclined to the belief that this method has but
little influence on the course of convalescence following labor.
Certain nervous and highly excitable women certainly seem to
do better, as a result of experiencing less pain and nervous
shock; while other cases do not turn out so well. It certainly
does not retard repair and recovery during the puerperium.</p>

<p>14. This method seems to have its greatest field of usefulness
in those cases of highly intelligent but excessively neurotic
women who have an abnormal dread of pain and child bearing;
or women who have suffered unusually at the time of a previous
confinement&mdash;perhaps in the case of the first baby&mdash;or from
other complications; women such as these, and other special
cases, are the ones to benefit most from the employment of
"twilight sleep."</p>

<p>15. This method as has already been intimated, is most useful
in the case of the first baby, or in the case of women who have
established a record of tedious and painful labors. It has no
place in normal and short labors; although it may be used to
great advantage in certain cases during the first stage of labor&mdash;being
carefully and lightly administered&mdash;while chloroform
or gas is utilized at the end of the second stage just as has been
our custom for a generation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span></p>

<p>16. As noted under the special claims made for this method,
it is (as also is nitrous oxid) the ideal procedure in cases of
heart, respiratory, kidney, and other organic difficulties, the
details of which have already been noted, and their repetition
here is not necessary.</p>

<p>17. It must be remembered that scopolamin and morphin are
more or less uncertain in their action; scopolamin is variable
in its results, often producing such marked nervous excitement
in the patient as greatly to interfere with the carrying out
of an aseptic technic; while morphin has been shunned by obstetricians
for a whole generation, because of its well-known
bad effects on the unborn child as well as its interference with
muscular activity on the part of the mother.</p>

<p>In Germany, it is said, that a great many damage suits
against prominent physicians have resulted because of the
alleged ill effects which have followed the use of "twilight
sleep."</p>

<p>18. In presenting these facts and opinions regarding "twilight
sleep," the reader should bear in mind that we are not
only endeavoring to state our own views and experience, but
also to give the reader just as clear and fair an idea of what
other and experienced physicians think of the method, both
favorably and unfavorably; and we will draw these conclusions
to a close by citing the opinion of one or two who have had
considerable experience with the method and who, in summing
up their observations, say:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The disadvantages of the method are entirely with the accoucheur
and not to the mother or child. <i>It requires his presence at the bedside
from the time the treatment is undertaken until the completion
of labor</i>, not so much because of any danger, but to keep the patient
evenly under anesthesia on a line midway between consciousness
and unconsciousness, for if she is allowed to go above that line in
several instances she will have several so-called "isles of memory,"
and will be able to draw a picture of her labor in her mind and
thus lose the benefit of the treatment.</p>

<p>These methods of anesthesia are very important and have merit.
They should be used when properly indicated. No one should limit
himself to a routine method. Each case should be individualized<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
and the form of anesthesia best suited to the case in hand should be
employed. For instance, in dealing with a primipara&mdash;one who is
full of fear, who cannot stand pain, who is of an hysterical
nature&mdash;morphin-scopolamin anesthesia is best suited in that particular
case, because these drugs have a selective action when it comes to allay
fear and produce amnesia. On the other hand, in a multipara who
has had three or four children, whose soft parts are relaxed and
who has short labors, the anesthetic of choice would be a few
whiffs of chloroform as the head passes over the perineum. It is
ridiculous to try to give such women the "twilight sleep." Furthermore,
take the cases you see for the first time at the end of the first
stage of labor, or during the second stage; these cases are best
treated with the nitrous oxid and oxygen method. You have to individualize
your cases. The prospective mother now consults the
obstetrician early to find out if her particular case is suitable for the
"twilight sleep." She has been informed that certain examinations&mdash;urine,
blood pressure, etc.&mdash;are necessary. She knows that these
examinations have to be made at regular intervals. In other words,
we get the patients early and we can give them good prenatal care.</p></div>

<p>This chapter has been devoted to "twilight sleep;" the following
chapter will consider "nitrous oxid" and other methods
of anesthesia in connection with labor, and should be read along
with the foregoing discussion in order to obtain an intelligent
view of the whole subject of "painless labor."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER X</h2>
<h2>SUNRISE SLUMBER AND NITROUS OXID</h2>
</div>

<p>Since the public has already been told so much about obstetric
anesthesia, we deem it best to go into the whole
subject thoroughly, so that the expectant mothers who read this
book will be able to form an intelligent opinion regarding the
question, and thus be in a position to give hearty cooperation
to the decision of their physician to employ, or not to employ,
any special form of anesthesia or analgesia in their particular
case. In order to give the reader a complete understanding of
"painless labor," it will be necessary to give attention to that
newer and more safe method of obstetric anesthesia called
"sunrise slumber." This method of anesthesia consists in the
employment of nitrous oxid or "laughing gas," and will be
fully considered in this chapter.</p>

<h4>OBSTETRIC FEAR</h4>

<p>In this connection we desire to reiterate and further emphasize
some statements made in the preceding chapter concerning the
unnatural fear and abnormal dread of childbirth.</p>

<p>We feel that it is very important in connection with this
new movement in obstetrics to reduce the woman's pain and
suffering to the lowest possible minimum, that the trials of
labor should not be overdrawn and the pangs of confinement
overestimated. We must not educate the normal woman to
look upon labor as a terrible ordeal&mdash;something like a major
surgical operation&mdash;which, since it cannot be escaped, must
be endured with the aid of a deep anesthesia.</p>

<p>The facts are that a very small per cent of healthy women
suffer any considerable degree of severe pain&mdash;at least not
after the first child. We often observe that judicious mental<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
suggestion on the part of the physician or nurse in the form of
encouraging words and supporting assurances tends to exert
a marked influence in controlling nervousness and subduing the
sufferings of the earlier labor pains.</p>

<p>We must not allow the efforts of medical science to lessen the
sufferings of child-bearing, to rob womankind of their natural
and commendable courage, endurance, and self-reliance.</p>

<p>We do not mean to perpetuate the old superstition that pain
and suffering are the necessary and inevitable accompaniments
of child-bearing&mdash;that the pangs of labor are a divine
sentence pronounced upon womankind&mdash;and that, therefore,
nothing should be done to lessen the sufferings of confinement.
Severe and unnatural pain is not at all necessary to childbirth,
and there exists no reason under the sun why women should
suffer and endure it, any more than they should suffer the horrors
of a very painful surgical operation without an anesthetic.
In this connection, it should be recalled that analgesic drugs have
been introduced into obstetric practice only during the last fifty
years, while such methods of relieving pain have been used
in general surgery for a much longer period. It is now only
sixty-nine years since Simpson first employed anesthetic in
obstetrics, while six years afterwards Queen Victoria gave her
seal of approval to the use of chloroform in labor cases.</p>

<p>Thirty years ago, in speaking of the expectant mothers, Lusk
warned us:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>As the nervous organization loses in the power of resistance as
the result of higher civilization and of artificial refinement, it
becomes imperatively necessary for the physician to guard her from
the dangers of excessive and too prolonged suffering.</p></div>

<h4>NITROUS OXID&mdash;"LAUGHING GAS"</h4>

<p>Nitrous oxid, or "laughing gas," was first used in labor cases
in 1880 by a Russian physician. During the last twenty-five
years it has been used off and on by numerous practitioners in
connection with confinement, but not until the last few years
has this method of relieving labor pain come into prominent
notice.</p>

<p>While the "laughing gas" method of obstetric anesthesia did<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
not gain notoriety and publicity from being exploited in magazines
and other lay publications, it did get its initial boost
in a very unique and unusual manner. A gentleman who
manufactured and sold a "laughing gas" and oxygen mixing
machine for the use of dentists, insisted that this method of
anesthesia should be used in the case of his daughter, who was
about to be confined. This patient was kept under this nitrous
oxid anesthetic for six hours&mdash;came out fine&mdash;no accidents
or other undesirable complications affecting either mother or
child, and thus another and safe method of reducing the sufferings
of childbirth has been fully demonstrated and confirmed,
although it had previously been known and used in labor cases
to some extent.</p>

<p>Starting from this particular case in 1913, many obstetricians
began experimental work with "gas" in labor cases; and, at
the time of this writing, it has come to occupy a permanent place
in the management of labor, alongside of chloroform, ether,
and "twilight sleep."</p>

<h4>ANALGESIA VS. ANESTHESIA</h4>

<p>The reader should understand the difference between
analgesia and anesthesia. Anesthesia refers to the condition
in which the patient is more or less unconscious&mdash;wholly or
partially oblivious to what is going on, and, of course, entirely
insensible to all pain. Analgesia is a term applied to the loss
of pain sensation. The patient may not be wholly or even partially
unconscious&mdash;merely under the influence of some agent
which dulls, deadens, or otherwise destroys the realization of
pain. This is the condition aimed at by the proper administration
of any form of "twilight sleep," whether by the scopolamin-morphin
method, or by the nitrous oxid ("sunrise slumber")
method.</p>

<p>Any method of treatment which can more or less destroy the
pain of labor without in any way interfering with its progress,
and which in no way complicates its course or leaves behind
any bad effects on either mother or child, must certainly be
hailed with joy by both the patient and the physician. While
chloroform has served these purposes fairly well, there have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
been numerous drawbacks and certain dangers; and it was the
knowledge of these limitations in the use of both chloroform
and ether, that has led to further experimentation and the
development of these newer methods of producing satisfactory
analgesia&mdash;freedom from pain&mdash;without bringing about such
a state of profound anesthesia as accompanies the administration
of the older methods.</p>

<p>It should be borne in mind that in using "sunrise slumber"
(nitrous oxid) for labor pains, the gas is so administered that
the patient is just kept on the "borderline"&mdash;in a typical "twilight"
state&mdash;and not in the condition of deep anesthesia which
is developed when nitrous oxid is employed by physicians and
dentists as an anesthetic for major and minor surgical operations.</p>

<p>Analgesia is the first stage of anesthesia&mdash;the "twilight
zone" of approaching unconsciousness&mdash;in which the sense
of pain is greatly dulled or entirely lost, while even that which
is experienced is not remembered. It seems to the authors that
"gas" is the ideal drug for producing this condition whenever it
is necessary, as nitrous oxid is the most volatile of anaesthetics,
acts most quickly, and its effects pass away most rapidly, while
its administration is under the most perfect control&mdash;it may be
administered with any desired proportion of oxygen&mdash;and may
be discontinued on a moment's notice. It is practically free
from danger even when continued as an analgesic for several
hours. Nitrous oxid never causes any serious disturbance in the
unborn child, as chloroform sometimes does when used
too liberally.</p>

<h4>EFFECTS OF NITROUS OXID</h4>

<p>It will not be necessary to compare the favorable and unfavorable
claims for nitrous oxid as we did the contentions for
and against "twilight sleep." Whatever service "laughing
gas" or "sunrise slumber" can render the cause of obstetrics
we can accept, knowing full well that, in competent hands, it
can do little or no harm; and this we know from the facts herewith
recited and from the further fact that we have gained a
wide experience with this agent in the practice of both dentistry<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
and surgery. In a general way, the influence of "sunrise slumber"
on mother and child may be summarized as follows:</p>

<p>1. It can accomplish its purpose&mdash;can quite satisfactorily
relieve the mother of severe pain&mdash;when employed as an
analgesic. It is not necessary to administer the gas to the point
of anesthesia except at the height of suffering at the end of the
second stage of labor, when the head of the child is passing
through the birth canal.</p>

<p>2. This method can be stopped at any moment&mdash;the patient
ran be brought out from under its influence entirely and almost
instantaneously. It is not like a hypodermic injection of a drug
which may exert a varying and unknown influence upon the
patient, and which, when once given, cannot be recalled.</p>

<p>3. It is a method which may be used in the patient's home
just as safely as in a hospital; the only drawback being the
inconvenience of transporting the gas-containing cylinders back
and forth. This is even now partially overcome by the improved
combination gas and oxygen form of apparatus which has been
devised.</p>

<p>4. The administration of nitrous oxid analgesia or anesthesia
does not interfere with or lessen the uterine contractions or
expulsive efforts on the part of the mother&mdash;at least not to
any appreciable extent.</p>

<p>5. Just as soon as a severe uterine contraction&mdash;attended by
its severe pain&mdash;begins to subside, the gas inhaler is immediately
removed, and in a few seconds the patient is again
conscious. It is not necessary to keep the patient continuously
under the influence of the drug, as in the case of the scopolamin-morphin
method of "twilight sleep."</p>

<p>6. This method ("sunrise slumber") is certainly far more
safe in ordinary and unskilled hands than the "twilight sleep"
procedure. The patient is more safe with this method in the
hands of the average doctor or trained nurse.</p>

<p>7. It has been our experience that nitrous oxid in the smaller,
interrupted and analgesic doses, actually tends to stimulate the
uterine pains and contractions, while at the same time rendering
the patient quite oblivious to their presence. When properly
administered, the freedom from pain is perfect.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span></p>

<p>8. Under the influence of "gas," patients often appear to
"bear down" with increased energy. It certainly does not
lessen their cooperation in this respect.</p>

<p>9. We have not observed, nor have we learned of, any cases
of inertia (weak and delayed contractions), post partum hemorrhage,
or shock, as a result of "laughing gas" or "sunrise
slumber" analgesia.</p>

<p>10. This method lends itself to perfect control&mdash;it may be
decreased, increased, or discontinued, at will; it may be given
light now and heavy at another time; while, at the height of
labor, it may be pushed to the point of complete anesthesia, if
desired.</p>

<p>11. We have found "sunrise slumber" (nitrous oxid) analgesia
to be the ideal obstetric anaesthetic, and have adopted it
quite to the exclusion of both chloroform and "twilight sleep."
We find that this form of analgesia has all the advantages of
"twilight sleep" without any of its dangers or disadvantages.</p>

<p>12. A possible objection to the nitrous-oxid method is the
cost, especially in the private home. The average cost in the
hospitals where we are using this method runs about $2.00 for
the first hour and $1.50 for each hour thereafter. This is the
cost when using large tanks of gas, and is, of course, somewhat
increased when the smaller tanks are used in the patient's
home.</p>

<h4>METHOD OF ADMINISTRATION</h4>

<p>Since it was thought best to give the reader some idea of the
technic for the administration of "twilight sleep," it may not
be amiss to explain how "sunrise slumber" is usually employed
in labor cases. The technic is very simple. The administration
of the gas is generally begun about the time the patient begins
seriously to complain of the severity of the second stage pains;
although, of course, the gas can be given during the first stage
pains if desired. In the vast majority of cases, however, we
think it is best to encourage the patient to endure these earlier
and lighter pains without resorting to analgesic procedures.</p>

<p>The form of apparatus used is the same as that employed
by dentists and contains both nitrous oxid and oxygen cylinders.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
A small nasal inhaler is best, although the ordinary mouthpiece
will do very well. The gasbag attached to the tank
should be kept under low pressure and, as a pain begins, the
patient is told to breathe quietly, keeping the mouth closed.
As a rule this sort of light inhalation serves to produce the
desired analgesic effect. It is not necessary to put the patient
deeply under in order to relieve the pain.</p>

<p>It is our custom to begin "sunrise slumber" as soon as the
uterine contractions become painful. The earlier the gas is
started, the more oxygen should be used. Two or three inhalations
will suffice to take the "edge" off the earlier and
lighter pains. When the pains grow heavier we use less oxygen
and permit three or four deep inhalations just before a bearing-down
pain. At the first suggestion of a contraction, the patient
must begin to inhale the gas; while after the patient has pulled
hard on the traction strops&mdash;just as the contraction pain is
passing&mdash;she is given an inhalation containing a larger percentage
of oxygen.</p>

<p>At the beginning of a pain, pure nitrous oxid is administered,
and the patient is instructed to breathe deeply and rapidly
through the nose. The gasbags should be about half filled.
The mixture of gas and oxygen must be determined by the
severity of the pains and individual behavior of the patient.</p>

<p>Four to six inhalations of the gas are sufficient to produce
the required analgesia in the average case. Following the first
few deep inspirations through the nose, the patient can be instructed
to breathe through the mouth, while the gas is well
diluted with oxygen and continued until the end of the pain.
In this way a satisfactory analgesia is maintained throughout
the "pain" with a minimum of "gas." The proportion of
oxygen used will run from nothing up to ten per cent. This
procedure is repeated with the occurrence of each pain.</p>

<p>The use of the "mask" is just as effective as a nasal inhaler,
but wastes more gas and so is more costly.</p>

<p>When the head is passing the perineum the gas should be
pushed to the point of anesthesia, while the patient's color will
suggest the amount of oxygen to be used as well as serve to
control the administration of the nitrous oxid.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span></p>

<h4>CHLOROFORM AND ETHER</h4>

<p>For many years chloroform and ether have been used to
alleviate the pains of women in labor. Valuable as these agents
are when deep anesthesia is required for the carrying out of
operative procedures, they have not proved satisfactory as
analgesic agents. If administered in small quantities at the commencement
of a strong uterine contraction, the patient does not
usually inhale sufficient to abolish pain. She is then apt to be
irritated and is certain to insist on being given a larger quantity.
If a sufficient amount be administered to satisfy the woman, the
continued repetition gradually inhibits the power both of the
uterus and of the accessory muscles, so that labor is unnecessarily
prolonged, and, possibly, the life of the fetus endangered.
Physicians have, therefore, been accustomed to employ these
drugs very sparingly, restricting their use to the very end of
the second stage, during the painful passage of the head through
the vulva. The results of the administration at this time are
also uncertain. If delivery be rapid the woman may not be
able to inhale sufficient to abolish her consciousness of pain.
If it be slow she may take too much and weaken the muscular
powers, thereby prolonging labor and, often, necessitating forceps
delivery. It is not surprising, therefore, that the medical
profession has long been hoping that a more satisfactory method
of relieving the pain of labor would be found.</p>

<h4>CONCLUSIONS</h4>

<p>In summing up our conclusions regarding analgesia and anesthesia
in labor cases, the authors would state their present position
as follows:</p>

<p>1. That anesthetics or analgesics are a necessary accompaniment
of confinement in this day and age; that the average
labor case demands some sort of pain-relieving agent at some
time during its progress; but that intelligent efforts should be
put forth to limit and otherwise control their use. While we
recognize the necessity for avoiding needless suffering, at the
same time we must also avoid turning our women into spineless
weaklings and timid babies.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span></p>

<p>2. That we should seek to develop, strengthen, and train our
girls for a normal and natural maternity; that we should study
to attain something of the naturalness and the painlessness of
the labors of Indian tribes; and, even if we partially fail in this
effort, we shall at least leave our women with ennobled characters
and strengthened wills.</p>

<p>3. That the scopolamin-morphin method of inducing "twilight
sleep" has its place&mdash;in the hands of experts&mdash;and in the
hospital; and that in many cases it probably represents the best
method of obstetric anesthesia which can be employed.</p>

<p>4. That as a general rule and in general practice, the safest
and best method of inducing the "twilight" state of freedom
from severe pain, is by the use of nitrous oxid or "laughing
gas"&mdash;the "sunrise slumber" method. It has been our practice
to start all general ether anesthetics with "gas" for a
number of years, while we have been doing an increasing number
of both minor and major operations with "gas" alone.</p>

<p>5. That we still employ general ether or chloroform anesthesia
in Cesarean sections and other major obstetric operations,
although several operators are beginning to use "gas" in even
these heavy cases.</p>

<p>6. That the intelligent and careful use of pituitary extract
in certain cases of labor serves greatly to shorten the second
stage; that it is of great value in certain "slow cases," and
serves greatly to reduce the use of low forceps.</p>

<p>We have treated the subject of obstetric anesthesia in this
full manner, because of the fact that so much has appeared
in the public press on these subjects, and, further, because we
desired that our readers should have placed before them the
facts on all sides of the question just as fully as a work of
this scope would permit.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XI</h2>
<h2>THE CONVALESCING MOTHER</h2>
</div>

<p>Popularly spoken of as the "lying-in period," and
medically known as the puerperium, this time of convalescence
immediately following childbirth is usually occupied by
two important things: the restoration of the pelvic organs to
their normal condition before pregnancy, and the starting of
that wonderfully adaptative mechanism concerned with the production
of the varying and daily changing food supply of the
offspring.</p>

<p>The uterus, now more than fifteen times its normal size and
weight, begins gradually to contract and assume its normal
weight of about two ounces; and it requires anywhere from
four to eight weeks to accomplish this involution. In view of
all this it is obvious that there can be no fixed time to "get up."
It may be at the end of two weeks, or it may not be until the
close of four or five weeks, in the case of the mother who cannot
nurse her child; for the nursing of the breast greatly facilitates
the shrinking of the uterus. Extensive lacerations may
hinder the involution as well as other accidents of childbirth,
so it must be left with the physician to decide in each individual
case when the mother may enter into the activities of life and
assume the responsibilities of the care of the baby and the
management of her home.</p>

<h4>THE NURSE</h4>

<p>During this period of the puerperium a member of the family,
a neighbor, a visiting nurse, a practical nurse, or a trained
nurse, looks after the mother and gives to the babe its first
care; whoever it may be, certain laws of cleanliness must be
carried out if infection is to be guarded against. If there are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
daily or semi-daily calls made by the physician, a member of
the family may be trained to care for the mother with proper
cleanliness and asepsis; but it is far better for the mother, if
possible, to secure the services of a trained nurse, or the visiting
nurse, in which instance she will call each day, wash and dress
the baby, clean up the mother and care for the breasts. She is
not supposed to clean the room, make the bed or prepare the
food. If a trained nurse can be in charge, the convalescing
time is usually shortened as the responsibilities are taken from
the mother, her mind freed from care and it is her's to improve,
rest, and wait for the restoration of the pelvic organs, when she
may again go forth among her family.</p>

<p>The nurse may have to sleep in the same room; but, if it be
possible, she should occupy an adjoining room, she should have
a regular time each day for an hour's walk in the fresh air, she
should be served regular meals, and be allowed some time out
of the twenty-four hours for unbroken slumber. In return she
will intelligently cooperate with the physician in bringing about
the restoration of body and upbuilding of the mother's nerves.</p>

<h4>REST AND EXERCISE</h4>

<p>From a monetary standpoint there can be nothing so wasteful
or extravagantly expensive in the home as to allow the mother
to drag about from day to day and week to week with chronic
weakness or invalidism because she did not have proper care
during her already too short puerperium, or because she got
up too soon.</p>

<p>Having a baby is a perfectly normal, physiological procedure.
It is also, usually, downright hard work; and, beside the hard
laborious work, there is not only a wearied and severely shocked
nervous system to be restored, but there is also a certain amount
of uterine shrinkage which must take place&mdash;and this requires
from four to eight weeks; and so our mother must be allowed
weeks or even a month or two to rest, to enjoy a certain amount
of well-directed exercise, to have an abundance of fresh air,
to be wheeled or lifted out of doors if possible into the sunshine,
that she may be the better prepared for the additional duties
and responsibilities the little new comer entails. Sunshine and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
fresh air are wonderful health restorers as is also a well-directed
cold water friction bath administered near the close of the
second week of a normal puerperium. During the second week
a few carefully selected exercises such as the following are not
only beneficial, but tend to increase circulation and thus to promote
the secretion of milk and the shrinking of the uterus.</p>

<ol>
<li>Head raising, body straight and stiffened.</li>
<li>Arm raising, well extended.</li>
<li>Leg stretching, with knees stretched and toe extended.</li>
<li>Massage, administered by the nurse.</li>
</ol>

<p>A splendid tonic circulatory bath may be administered at the
close of the second week (in normal puerperium), known as the
"cold mitten friction," which is administered as follows: The
patient is wrapped in a warm blanket, hot water bottle at feet,
and each part of the body&mdash;first one arm then the other; the
chest, the legs, one at a time&mdash;is briskly rubbed with a coarse
mit dipped in ice water. As one part is dried it is warmly
covered, while the next part is taken, and so on until the entire
body has been treated. The body is now all aglow, the blood
tingling through the veins, and the patient refreshed by this
wide-a-wake bath. Properly given, the cold-mitten friction bath
is one of the most enjoyable treatments known and under
ordinary conditions, if intelligently administered, may be given
as early as the eighth day.</p>

<h4>AFTER PAINS</h4>

<p>After the birth of the first baby the uterus usually is in a
state of constant contraction, hence there are no "after pains;"
but after the birth of the second or third child, the uterine
muscle has lost some of the tone of earlier days&mdash;there is a
tendency toward relaxation&mdash;so that when the uterine muscle
does make renewed efforts at contraction, these "after pains"
are produced. They usually disappear by the third day. Nothing
should be done for them, indeed they should be welcomed,
for their presence means good involution (contraction) of the
uterus.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span></p>

<h4>THE TEMPERATURE</h4>

<p>Careful notations of the temperature should be made during
the first week. A temperature chart should be accurately kept
and if the temperature should rise above 100&deg; the physician
should be notified at once. The third day temperature is
watched with expectancy, for if an accidental infection occurred
at the time of labor, it is usually announced by a chill and
sudden rise of temperature on the third day. This may be as
good a place as any to mention the commonly met night sweating.
This is due to a marked accentuation of the function of
the skin. It is not at all unusual for a sleeping mother in the
early puerperium to wake up in a sweat with night gown very
nearly drenched. The gown should be changed underneath the
bedding, while alcohol is rubbed over the moistened skin surface.</p>

<p>These sweats will disappear as soon as the mother begins to
regain her strength. A vinegar rub administered on going to
bed may often prevent these sweats.</p>

<h4>THE TOILET OF THE VULVA</h4>

<p>Immediately after the birth of the baby and the expulsion of
the afterbirth, the thighs and vulva are cleansed as follows:
Into a basin of warm, boiled water are dropped four small
antiseptic tablets of bichlorid of mercury; this gives a proper
antiseptic wash. Into this solution are placed four pieces of
sterile cotton Two of these are used, one at a time, without being
returned to the solution to wash each inside of the thigh, the
remaining two to cleanse the vulva. Without drying the vulva,
two sterile pads are applied and pinned to the binder. These
pads are changed every hour during the first day or two because
of the profuse lochial flow.</p>

<p>After each urination and bowel movement, a lysol solution
(prepared by putting one teaspoonful of lysol in a quart of
sterile water) is poured from a clean pitcher over the vulva
into the bed pan, and fresh pads applied. This toilet continues
until the close of the second week or longer, if there is a lochial
flow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span></p>

<p>These sterile pads not only absorb the lochia but also, among
ignorant or thoughtless mothers, prevent contamination by the
patient's hands.</p>

<h4>URINATION</h4>

<p>The patient should be encouraged to urinate during the first
few hours after labor; catheterization should not take place
until every effort has been made to bring about normal urination;
or, until there is a well marked tumor above the bony arch
of the pelvis in the lower part of the abdomen. It is far less
harmful to the patient for her to sit up on the jar placed on the
edge of the bed, than to undergo the risk of inflammation of the
bladder which so often follows catheterization.</p>

<h4>THE LOCHIA</h4>

<p>The first few days the lochia is very red because of the large
amount of blood which it contains. After the third or fourth
day it is paler and after the tenth it assumes a whitish or
yellowish color. During the three changes it should always
smell like fresh blood. Any foul, putrifying odor should be
promptly reported to the physician.</p>

<p>If on getting up at the close of the second week the lochia
should resume its red color, the patient should return to bed and
notify her physician.</p>

<h4>THE ABDOMINAL BINDER</h4>

<p>After the tenth day, the abdominal binder may be pinned as
tightly as the patient desires, but prior to the tenth day many
physicians believe the exceedingly tight binder causes misplacements
of the enlarged, softened, and boggy uterus. It
should be pinned snugly; but not drawn as tight as possible with
the idea of keeping the uterus from relaxing, for at best, it
does not do it; while tight constriction may produce a serious
turning or flexion of the uterus. The breast binder is applied
during the first twenty-four hours to support the filling breasts,
loosely at first, and as they increase in size, as the glands
become engorged, the binder is drawn more tightly. A sterile
piece of gauze is placed over the nipples.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span></p>

<h4>THE BOWELS</h4>

<p>On the morning of the second day a cathartic is usually
given&mdash;say one ounce of castor oil or one-half bottle of citrate
of magnesia. The bowels should move at least once during each
twenty-four hours; if they are obstinate, a simple laxative
may be nightly administered. Certain constipation biscuits,
sterilized dry bran, or agar-agar may be eaten with the breakfast
cereal. Prunes and figs should be used abundantly. Bran
bread should be substituted for white bread. The enema habit
is a bad one and should not be encouraged; however, the enema
is probably less harmful than the laxative-drug habit. Mineral
oil is useful as a mild laxative, and does not produce any bad
after results.</p>

<h4>CARE OF THE NIPPLES</h4>

<p>Fissures of the nipples should be reported to the physician at
once. There are many good remedies which the physician may
suggest; in his absence, Balsam Peru may be advantageously
applied. Boracic acid solution should be applied before and
after each nursing from the very first day; in this way much
nipple trouble may be prevented through cleanliness and care.
The nipples should be kept thoroughly dry between nursings
Nipple shields should be used where fissures persist.</p>

<h4>THE DIET</h4>

<p>For the first three days a liquid and soft diet is followed
such as hot or cold milk, gruels, soups, thin cereals, eggnog
(without whiskey), eggs, cocoa, dry toast, dipped toast, or
cream toast. There should be three meals with a glass of hot
milk at five in the morning (if awake) and late at night; nothing
between meals except plenty of good cold water. After the
third day, if temperature is normal, a semi-solid diet may be
taken, such as baked, mashed, or creamed potatoes, soups
thickened with rice, barley or flour, vegetables (peas, corn,
asparagus, celery, spinach, etc.); eggs, light meats, stale breads,
toast, bland or subacid fruits (sweet apples, prunes, figs, dates,
pears, etc.); macaroni, browned rice (parched before steaming),
etc.; ice cream, custards, and rice puddings for desserts after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
the seventh day. Three good meals a day, at eight and one
and six, with a couple of glasses of hot milk or cocoa or an
eggnog at five <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>, to be repeated at 9 or 10 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>,
with plenty of cold water between the meals, will abundantly supply
the necessary milk for the growing babe. Tea and coffee are
not of any special value in encouraging a flow of milk.</p>

<p>The constant coaxing of the mother with "Do drink this,"
and "You must drink this, or you won't have any milk," not
only saddens her but seriously upsets digestion and thus indirectly
interferes with normal lactation.</p>

<h4>GETTING UP</h4>

<p>Everybody should stay at home and away from the mother
and her new born child until after the seventh day, and then,
if our patient is normal, visitors may call, but should not stay
longer than five minutes. The convalescing mother will improve
faster without the neighborhood gossip, or the tales of woe so
often carried by well-meaning, but woefully ignorant acquaintances.</p>

<p>When the hard ball-like mass can no longer be felt in the
lower abdomen, when the lochia has passed through the three
changes already mentioned, and the flow is whitish or yellowish,
scanty and odorless, the patient may sit up in a chair increasingly
each day. Such conditions are usually found anywhere
from the tenth to the fifteenth day. The patient first sits up
a little in a chair&mdash;she has already been exercising some in
bed&mdash;and this enables her to sit up with ease for a half-hour
the first day, increasing one-half hour each day during the week
following. At the end of three weeks, she may be taken down
stairs providing there is ample help to carry her back up stairs.
After another week (at the close of the fourth), if the lochia
is entirely white or yellow, with no blood, she may begin carefully
to go about the house. There should be no lifting, shoving,
pulling, wringing, sweeping, washing, ironing, or other heavy
exercise for at least another two weeks, better four weeks.
Any variance from this program usually means backache, lassitude,
diminished milk supply, and frequently a general invalidism
for weeks or months&mdash;sometimes years.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span></p>

<h4>COMPLICATIONS</h4>

<p><i>Cystitis</i>, or painful urination, is avoided by tardy "getting
up;" quietly, slowly moving about; abundant water drinking;
and the avoidance of catheterization.</p>

<p><i>Hemorrhage.</i> Notify the physician if it occurs at any time.
The treatment is heavy kneading of the abdomen until the uterus
again becomes like a hard ball. Cold compresses over the lower
abdomen may sometimes help.</p>

<p><i>Infection</i> is manifested by chilly sensations or a distinct chill
followed by fever, usually on the third day. Take a cathartic;
notify the physician at once and follow his directions.</p>

<p><i>Mastitis</i>, inflammation or caking of the breasts. Very hot
fomentations wrung out of boiling water, alternating with ice-cold
compress, should be applied to the breast for an hour
or more, three or four times a day. Cathartics should be
administered, and eliminative measures instituted such as the
hot-blanket pack.</p>

<p><i>Pneumonia.</i> Keeping the arms and chest well protected by a
long-sleeved coat of warm texture, should help in preventing
this serious complication. Pneumonia complicating labor is
usually the result of carelessness and exposure.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XII</h2>
<h2>BABY'S EARLY DAYS</h2>
</div>

<p>Happy is the mother and fortunate is the home that possesses
the intelligent services of a trained attendant during
the early days of the baby's career. A century or more ago
skilled nurses were unheard of, and both mothers and babies
seemed to thrive on the unskilled but faithful and sympathetic
care given by the willing neighbor who "thought I'd just run
over and help out." Who of us cannot remember the days
when mother was "gone to a neighbor's" to give this same willing
but unskilled care at the time of "confinement."</p>

<h4>MODERN METHODS</h4>

<p>And why are we so concerned today about asepsis, sterilization,
etc., when a generation ago they were not? We used to
live more slowly than we do now. Then it took the entire day
to do the marketing for the week, now we take a receiver from
the hook and a telephone wire transmits the verbal message.
Our days are literally congested with events that were almost
impossibilities a century ago. The ease and leisure of former
days are unknown and unheard of today. The artificial way in
which we live exerts more or less of a strain upon the present
generation; the average woman's nervous system is keyed up
to a high pitch; her general vital resistance is running at a
low ebb; while child-bearing brings a certain added stress and
strain that requires much planning to avoid and overcome.</p>

<p>For many days and ofttimes weeks the mother is unfit&mdash;physically
unable&mdash;properly to care for her child, and so<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
whether it be the trained assistant in constant attendance or the
visiting nurse in her daily calls, or the kind, willing, but unskilled
neighbor&mdash;each helper must acquaint herself, in varying degrees,
with the physical, nervous, and mental needs of the
child, as well as take into account and anticipate the numerous
habits and wants of the new born babe, such as urination, bowel
movement, pulse, respiration, temperature, etc.</p>

<h4>THE HEAD</h4>

<p>At birth, the head is remarkably large as compared to the
rest of the body, for, surprising as it may seem, the distance
from the crown to the chin is equal to the length of the baby's
trunk; and, too, if birth has been prolonged this large head has
also been pressed or squeezed somewhat out of shape. This
state of affairs, however, need give no cause for either alarm
or anxiety, for the head will shape itself to the beautiful rotundity
of the normal baby's head within a few days.</p>

<p>The general shape of the baby's head, as seen from above is
oval. Just back of the forehead is formed a diamond-shaped
soft spot known as the anterior fontanelle which should measure
a little more than one inch from side to side. On a line just
posterior to this soft spot and to the back of the head, is
found another soft spot somewhat smaller than the one in front.
Gradual closure of these openings in the bones occurs, until at
the end of six or eight months, the posterior fontanelle is
entirely closed; while eighteen months are required for the
closure of the anterior fontanelle.</p>

<p>These "soft spots" should not be depressed neither should
they bulge. The head is usually covered with a growth of soft,
silky hair which will soon drop out, to be replaced, however, by
a crop of coarser hair in due season. The scalp should always
be perfectly smooth. Any rash or crusts or accumulation of
any kind on the scalp is due to uncleanliness and neglect, and
should be carefully removed by the thorough application of
vaseline followed by a soap wash. The vaseline should be
applied daily until all signs of the accumulation are entirely
removed. The eyes of all babies are generally varying tints
of blue, but usually change to a lighter or darker hue by the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
seventh or eighth week. The whitish fur which often is seen
on the baby's tongue is the result of a dry condition of the
mouth which disappears as soon as the saliva becomes more
abundant.</p>

<h4>CHEST, ABDOMEN, AND LEGS</h4>

<p>The baby's chest, as compared to the size of the head and
abdomen, appears at a disadvantage, while the arms are comparatively
short and the legs particularly so, since they measure
about the same as the length of the trunk. They naturally
"bow in" at birth so that the soles of the feet turn decidedly
toward each other. All these apparent deformities, as a rule,
right themselves without any help or attention whatsoever.</p>

<h4>PULSE AND RESPIRATION</h4>

<p>The pulse may be watched at the anterior fontanelle or soft
spot on top of the head while the child quietly sleeps and should
record, at varying ages, as follows:</p>

<table border="0" width="450" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="Breathing">
<col width="70%" />
<col width="30%" />
<tr><td align="left" valign="top">At birth</td><td align="right" valign="top">130 to 150</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top">First month</td><td align="right" valign="top">120 to 140</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top">One to six months</td><td align="right" valign="top">about 130</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top">Six months to one year</td><td align="right" valign="top">about 120</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top">One to two years</td><td align="right" valign="top">110 to 120</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top">Two to four years</td><td align="right" valign="top">90 to 110</td></tr>
</table>

<p>The above table is correct for the inactive normal child.
Muscular activity, such as crying and sucking, increases the
pulse rate from 10 to 20 beats per minute.</p>

<p>The respiration of the baby often gives us no small amount
of real concern at the first. The baby may be limp and breathless
for some few moments at birth, and this condition calls
for quick action on the part of the nurse and doctor.</p>

<p>The utmost care to avoid the "sucking in" of any liquid
or blood during its birth must be exercised, for this often
seriously interferes with the breathing. Sometimes this condition
is not relieved until a soft rubber catheter is placed in the
throat and the mucus is removed by quick suction. When you
are reasonably sure that there is no more mucus in the throat,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
then sudden blowing into the baby's lungs (its lips closely in
touch with the lips of the nurse or physician) often starts
respiration. Slapping it on the back also helps, while the quick
dip into first hot then cold water seldom fails to give relief.</p>

<p>A quiet-sleeping infant breathes as shown below at varying
ages. An increase of six to ten breaths per minute may be
allowed for the time it is awake or otherwise active.</p>

</table>

<h4>THE WEIGHT</h4>

<p>The normal weight of the average baby is seven to seven and
one-half pounds. Its length may range anywhere from sixteen
to twenty-two inches.</p>

<p>There is an initial loss of weight during the first few days;
however, after the milk has been established the child should
make a weekly gain of four to eight ounces until it is six
months old, after which time the usual gain is from two to
four ounces per week.</p>

<p>If the weight has been doubled at six months and the weight
at one year is three times the birth weight, the child is said to
have gained evenly and normally.</p>

<h4>THE SKIN</h4>

<p>At birth the skin of the baby is red and very soft owing to
the presence of a coating of fine down. A blue-tinged skin
may be occasioned by unnecessary exposure or it may be due
to an opening in the middle partition of the heart which should
close at birth. As soon as the baby is born, it should be placed
on its right side while the cord is being tied, as this position
facilitates closure of this embryonic heart opening. With the
provision for a little additional heat the blue color should
disappear, if it is not due to this heart condition. At the close
of the first week the red color of the skin changes to a yellow
tint due to the presence of a small amount of bile in the blood.
This sort of jaundice is very common and is in no wise evidence<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
of disease. The "down" falls off with the peeling of the skin
which takes place during the second week; by the end of which
time, the skin is smooth and assumes that delightful "baby"
character so much admired.</p>

<h4>THE CORD DRESSING</h4>

<p>The cut end of the tied umbilical cord is swabbed and
squeezed with a sterile sponge saturated with pure alcohol. It
is then wrapped in a sterile dressing made as follows: Four or
five thicknesses of sterile cheese cloth are cut into a four-inch
square with a small hole cut in the center and one side cut to
this center. This is slipped about the stump of the cord and
wrapped around and about in such a manner as entirely to
cover the stump of the cord. The wool binder is then applied
and sewed on, thus avoiding both pressure and the prick of
pins. If it remains dry this dressing is not disturbed until the
seventh or eighth day, when the cord ordinarily drops off.
Should it become moistened the dressing is removed and the
second dressing is applied exactly like the first.</p>

<h4>THE EYES</h4>

<p>The closed eyes of the newly born child are generally covered
with mucus which should be carefully wiped off with a
piece of sterile cotton dipped in boracic acid solution, in a
manner not to disturb the closed lid. A separate piece of cotton
is used for each eye and the swabbing is done from the nose
outward. The physician or nurse drops into each opened eye
two drops of twenty per cent argyrol, the surplus medicine
being carefully wiped off with a separate piece of cotton for
each eye. The baby should now be placed in a darkened
corner of the room, protected from the cold.</p>

<p>The eyes are washed daily by dropping saturated solution
of boracic acid into each eye with a medicine dropper. Separate
pieces of gauze or cotton are used for each eye.</p>

<h4>THE FIRST OIL BATH</h4>

<p>As soon as the cord and the eyes have received the proper
attention and the mother has been made comfortable, the baby<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
is given its initial bath of oil. This oil may be lard, olive oil,
sweet oil, or liquid vaseline. The oil should be warmed and the
baby should be well covered with a warm blanket and placed on
a table which is covered with a thick pad or pillow. The temperature
of the room should be at least eighty degrees Fahrenheit.
Quickly, thoroughly, and carefully the entire body is swabbed
with the warmed oil&mdash;the head, neck, behind the ears, under
the arms, the groin, the folds of the elbow and knee&mdash;no part
of the body is left untouched, save the cord with its dressing.
This oil is then all gently rubbed off with an old soft linen
towel.</p>

<h4>THE FIRST CLOTHING</h4>

<p>After the oil bath, the silk and wool shirt (size No. 2), the
diaper and stockings are quickly put on to avoid the least
danger of chilling. The band having been applied at the time
of the dressing of the cord, our baby is now ready for the
flannel skirt. This should hang from the shoulders by a yoke
of material adapted to the season, cotton yoke without sleeves
if a summer baby, and a woolen yoke with woolen sleeves if
a winter baby. The outing-flannel night dress completes the
outfit and should be the only style of dress worn for the first
two weeks. Loosely wrapped in a warm shawl, the baby is
about ready for its first nap, save for a drink of cooled, boiled
water.</p>

<p>This cooled, boiled, unsweetened water should be given in
increasing amounts every two hours until the child is two or
three years of age. It is usually given the child in a nursing
bottle. In this way it is taken comfortably, slowly, can be kept
clean and warm, and should the babe be robbed of its natural
food and transferred to the bottle as a substitute for mother's
milk, it will already be acquainted with the bottle and thus
one-half of a hard battle has already been fought and won.</p>

<h4>BABY'S FIRST NAP</h4>

<p>The baby's bed should be separate and apart from the
mother's. It may be a well-padded box, a dresser drawer, a
clothes basket, or a large market basket. A folded comfortable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
slipped in a pillow slip makes a good mattress. A most ideal
bed may be made out of a clothes basket; the mattress or pad
should come up to within two or three inches of the top, so the
baby may breathe good fresh air and not the stale air that is
always found in a deeply made bed. Into this individual bed
the baby is placed as soon as it is dressed; and a good sleep of
four to six hours usually follows.</p>

<p>Frequent observations of the cord dressing should be made
as occasionally hemorrhage does take place, much to the detriment
of the babe. If bleeding is at any time discovered the cord
is retied just below the original tying. By the time baby has
finished a six- or eight-hour nap the mother is wondrously
refreshed and is ready to receive it to her breast.</p>

<h4>PUTTING TO THE BREAST</h4>

<p>During the first two days the baby draws from the breasts
little more than a sweetened watery fluid known as the colostrum;
but its intake is essential to the child in that it acts as
a good laxative which causes the emptying of the alimentary
tract of the dark, tarry appearing stools known as the meconium.
On the third day this form of stool disappears and there follows
a soft, yellow stool two or three times a day.</p>

<p>The child should be put to the breast regularly every four
hours; two things being thus encouraged: an abundant supply
of milk on the third day and the early shrinking of the uterus.
More than once a mother has missed the blessed privilege of
suckling her child because some thoughtless person told her
"why trouble yourself with nursing the baby every four hours,
there's nothing there, wait until the third day;" and so when
the third day came, there was little more than a mere suggestion
of a scanty flow of milk, which steadily grew less and less.</p>

<h4>THE URINE</h4>

<p>The urine of the very young child should be clear, free from
odor and should not stain the diaper, nor should it irritate the
skin of the babe. Often urination does not take place for several
hours, sometimes not at all during the first twenty-four
hours. If the infant does not show signs of distress, there is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
no cause for alarm; the urine should pass, however, within
thirty hours. As a rule there are usually between ten and
twenty wet diapers during each twenty-four hours. The following
table shows about the amounts of urine at different ages:</p>

<table border="0" width="450" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="Breathing">

<tr><td align="left" valign="top">Five to ten years</td><td align="right" valign="top">25 to 35 ounces</td></tr>
</table>

<h4>GENITALS OF THE MALE CHILD</h4>

<p>The foreskin of the male child is often long, tight, and
adherent, and is often the direct cause of irritability, nervousness,
crying, and too frequent urination. It should be closely
examined by both physician and nurse and when the foreskin
does not readily slip back over the acorn-like head of the
organ, circumcision is advised early in the second week. This
simple operation will start the child out on his career with
at least one moral handicap removed and one desirable possibility
established&mdash;that of being able to keep himself clean.</p>

<h4>POST-OPERATIVE CARE OF CIRCUMCISION</h4>

<p>The dressings that are loosely applied at the time of the
operation should remain untouched (especially those next to
the skin), unless otherwise directed by the physician, until the
seventh or eighth day when the babe is placed in a warm soap
bath, at which time the dressings all come off together. Clean
sterile gauze is so placed as entirely to protect the inflamed
skin from the diaper at all times before this bath, and these
same dressings should be continued for at least another week.
Sterile vaseline (from a tube) should be applied twice a day
after the original dressings are removed in the bath at the end
of the first week. There should be little or no bleeding following
the operation, neither should the penis swell markedly; if
either complication should occur, the physician should be
promptly notified.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 6. How to Hold the Baby.</span>
</div>

<h4>CARE OF THE FEMALE GENITALS</h4>

<p>The girl baby is often neglected in respect to the proper care
of the genitals. The lips of the vulva should be separated and
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>thorough but careful cleaning should be the daily routine. The
foreskin or covering of the clitoris should not be adherent;
while the presence of mucus, pus, or blood in the vulva should
be at once reported to the physician; in his absence, the application
of twenty per cent argyrol should be made daily.</p>

<h4>HANDLING THE BABY</h4>

<p>Let us thoroughly come to understand the very first day
the little one's life, that it was not sent to us because the family
needed something to play with; it is not a ball to toss up,
neither is it a variety show. It is a tiny individual, and your
responsibilities as parents and caretakers are very great. The
child was sent to be fed, clothed, kept warm, dry, and otherwise
cared for by you, until such a time as it will become able to
care for itself. Remember, what we sow, that shall we also reap.
If we sow indulgence we shall reap anger, selfishness, irritability,
"unbecomingness"&mdash;the spoiled child. At two or
three days the baby learns that when it opens its mouth and
emits a holler, someone immediately comes. If we do it on the
second and third day, why should we object to run, bow, and
indulge on the one hundredth and second day?</p>

<p>Handle the baby as little as possible. Turn occasionally from
side to side, feed it, change it, keep it warm, and let it alone;
crying is absolutely essential to the development of good strong
lungs. A baby should cry vigorously several times each day.
If the baby is to be handled, support the back carefully (<a href="#illus-008">Fig. 6</a>).</p>

<h4>THE EARLY BATHS</h4>

<p>During the first week the baby is oiled daily over his entire
body, with the exception that the cord dressing remains untouched.
The face, hands, and buttocks are washed in warm
water. After the third week the bathroom is thoroughly
warmed and the small tub is filled with water at temperature of
100 F. The baby having been stripped and wrapped in a warm
turkish towel, is placed on a table protected by a pillow, while
the caretaker stands by and vaselines the creases of the neck,
armpits, folds of the elbows, knees, thighs, wrists, and genitals;
and then, with her own hands, she applies soap suds all over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
the body&mdash;every portion of which is more quickly and readily
reached&mdash;than by the use of a wash cloth. And now, with
the bath at 100 F., with a folded towel on the bottom of the
small tub, the soapy child is placed into the water and after
a thorough rinsing is lifted out again to a warm fresh towel
on the table and the careful drying is quickly begun. After
the bath all the folds and creases are given a light dusting with
a good talcum.</p>

<p>During hot weather the bath should be given daily, soap
being used twice a week. On the other days there should be the
simple dipping of the child into the tub. During the cold
weather the full bath is given but twice a week, while on the
other days a sponge bath or an oil rub may be administered.</p>

<p>A weak, delicate child should not be exposed to the daily
full bath, but rather the semi-weekly sponge bath and the daily
oil rub should be administered. We have found the late afternoon
hour to be better than the early morning hour for baby's
bath. It requires too much vital resistance to react to an early
morning bath, especially when the house is cool.</p>

<h4>REGARDING SOAP</h4>

<p>The use of soap is very much abused with young babies.
I recall one mother who came into the office with her poor
little baby which was constantly crying and fretting because of
a greatly inflamed body&mdash;all a result of the too frequent use
of soap. I said, "I am afraid you do not keep your baby clean."
"O Doctor!" she replied, "I wash him with soap every time
I change him; I am sure he is clean." And come to find out,
the poor little fellow's tender skin had been subjected to soap
several times a day. We ordered the use of all soap discontinued,
vaseline and talcum powder to be used instead, and the
child's skin got well in a very short time.</p>

<h4>CARE OF THE UMBILICUS</h4>

<p>Tight bands should not be placed about the babe. If the
umbilicus protrudes, do not endeavor to hold it in by a tight
band, but consult your physician about the use of a bit of folded
cotton and adhesive plaster, and then allow the child the free<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>dom
of the knitted bands, with skirts suspended from yokes.
The day of tight bands and pinning blankets with their
additional and traditional windings is over. After the complete
healing of the cord, the need for a snug binder to hold the
dressings in place is over. Should the baby cry violently,
the umbilicus should be protected in the manner described above&mdash;the
fold of cotton and the adhesive plaster.</p>

<p>The diaper, stockings, shirt, skirt, and dress with an additional
wrapper for cold days completes the outfit at this age.</p>

<h4>BIRTH REGISTRATION</h4>

<p>"One of the most important services to render the newborn
baby is to have his birth promptly and properly registered."</p>

<p>In most states the attending physician or midwife is required
by law to report the birth to the proper authority, who will see
that the child's name, the date of his birth, and other particulars
are made a matter of public record. Birth registration may be
of the greatest importance when the child is older, and parents
should make sure this duty is not neglected.</p>

<p>A public health official some time ago epitomized some of the
uses of birth registration as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>There is hardly a relation in life from the cradle to the grave in
which such a record may not prove to be of the greatest value. For
example, in the matter of descent; in the relations of wards and
guardians; in the disabilities of minors; in the administration of
estates; the settlement of insurance and pensions; the requirements
of foreign countries in matters of residence, marriage, and legacies;
in marriage in our own country; in voting and in jury and militia
service; in the right to admission and practice in the professions
and many public offices; in the enforcement of laws relating to
education and to child labor, as well as to various matters in the
criminal code; the irresponsibility of children under ten for crime
or misdemeanor; the determination of the age of consent, etc., etc.</p></div>

<h2>CHAPTER XIII</h2>
<h2>THE NURSERY</h2>
</div>

<p>We wish it were possible for every mother who reads this
book to have a special baby's room or nursery. Some of
our readers have a separate nursery-room for the little folks,
and so we will devote a portion of this chapter to the description
of what seems to us a model arrangement for such a room;
but, realizing that ninety-five per cent of our readers can only
devote a corner of their own bedroom to the oncoming citizen,
we have also carefully sought to meet their needs and help
them to take what they have and make it just as near like the
ideal nursery as possible.</p>

<h4>THE SEPARATE NURSERY</h4>

<p>The nursery should be a quiet room with a south or southwesterly
exposure. The bathroom should adjoin or at least be
near. A screened-in porch is very desirable.</p>

<p>Draperies that cannot be washed, and upholstered furniture,
do not belong in the baby's room. A hardwood floor is better
than a carpet or matting; while a few light-weight rugs, easily
cleaned, are advisable. Enameled walls are easily washed and
are, therefore, preferable to wall paper or other dressings.</p>

<p>The windows should be well screened, for by far the greatest
dangers to which the baby is exposed, are flies and mosquitoes&mdash;carriers
of filth and disease. Flies, mosquitoes, cockroaches,
bed bugs, cats, dogs, lice, and mice are all disease carriers and
must therefore be kept out of baby's room.</p>

<h4>NURSERY EQUIPMENT</h4>

<p>At each window should be found dark shades, and if curtains
are desired they should be of an easily washable material, such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
as mull, swiss, lawn, voile, or scrim. The hardwood floor may
be covered where necessary with easily handled rugs which
should be aired daily. The other necessary articles of furniture
are a crib of enameled iron whose bedding will be described
elsewhere in this chapter, a chest for baby's clothes and other
necessary supplies, a screen or two, a low table and a low
rocker, a small clothes rack on which to air the clothes at
night, a pair of scales, and a medicine chest placed high on the
wall.</p>

<p>If the room will conveniently admit it, a couch will add
greatly to the mother's comfort; and, if possible, it should be
of leather upholstery; otherwise, it should possess a washable
cover, for all articles that promote the accumulation of dust are
not to be allowed in the nursery. In these early weeks and
months baby will not benefit from pictures or other wall decorations,
and so let him have clean walls that are easily washed
and quickly dusted.</p>

<p>The necessities for baby's personal care are:</p>

<h4>BABY'S BED</h4>

<p>Since the days of Solomon, accidents have occurred where
mother and babe have occupied the same bed. Not only is there
the ever-present danger of smothering the babe, but there are
also many other reasons why a baby should have its own bed.
The constant tendency to nurse it too often and the possibility
of the bed clothing shutting off the fresh air supply, are in and
of themselves sufficient reasons for having a separate bed for
baby.</p>

<p>The first bed is usually a basinet&mdash;a wicker basket with high
sides&mdash;with or without a hood. A suitable washable lining<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
and outside drape present a neat as well as sanitary appearance.
The mattress of the basinet is usually a folded clean comfort
slipped into a pillow slip; this is to be preferred to a feather
pillow, as it is cooler and in every way better for the babe.</p>

<p>Drapes about the head of the basinet are not only often in
the way, shutting out air, etc., but they also gather dust and
are unsanitary. Screens are movable&mdash;they may be used or
put away at will&mdash;and are, therefore, very convenient about
the nursery.</p>

<p>The basinet may be dispensed with entirely if the sides of the
enameled crib are lined to cut off draughts and the babe is
properly supported by pillows. After the baby is four to six
months of age it is transferred to the crib. The basinet has an
advantage over the crib during those early weeks in that its
high sides protect the babe from draughts, and the comforts and
blankets can be more easily tucked about the little fellow to
keep him warm. The sides should not extend more than four
inches above the lying position of the child.</p>

<h4>THE CRIB</h4>

<p>The enameled iron crib should be provided with a woven-wire
mattress, over which is placed a mattress; hair is best as a
filling for the mattress, wool next, and cotton last. Over the
mattress should be placed a rubber sheet, and over all a folded
sheet.</p>

<p>A pillow of hair or down is not to be discarded; for recent
investigation has shown that the pillow favors nasal drainage,
while lying flat encourages the retaining of mucus in the nose
and nasal chambers&mdash;the sinuses. The pillow slip should be of
linen texture.</p>

<p>During the winter a folded soft blanket over the rubber
sheet increases both softness and warmth. No top sheet is used
during the first months, particularly if the first months are the
winter months. The baby is wrapped loosely in a light weight
clean blanket or shawl, and other blankets&mdash;as many as the
season demands are tucked about the child. These blankets
should be aired daily, and the one next to the baby changed,
aired, or washed very often.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span></p>

<h4>THE SLEEPING BLANKET</h4>

<p>To prevent baby from becoming uncovered the sleeping
blanket has been devised. The blanket is folded and stitched
in such a way as completely to envelop the sleeping babe, and
at the same time afford the utmost freedom (<a href="#illus-009">Fig. 7</a>). The
babe may turn as often as he desires, but cannot possibly
uncover himself. Bed clothes fasteners are also used&mdash;an
elastic tape being securely fastened to the head posts and
then by means of clamps or safety pins attachment is made to
the blankets on either side. The elasticity allows considerable
freedom to the child in turning (See <a href="#illus-010">Fig. 8</a>).</p>

<h4>NURSERY HEATING AND VENTILATION</h4>

<p>The subject of ventilation has been so fully discussed by the
authors in another work that we refer the reader to <i>The Science
of Living, or the Art of Keeping Well</i>.</p>

<p>For the first two or three weeks the nursery temperature
should be maintained at seventy degrees Fahrenheit by day
and from sixty degrees to sixty-five degrees by night. In the
third week the day temperature should be sixty-eight degrees
Fahrenheit measured by a thermometer hanging three feet
from the floor. After three months the night temperature may
go as low as fifty-five degrees Fahrenheit, and after the first
year it may go as low as forty-five degrees.</p>

<p>The heating of the nursery is usually controlled by the general
heating plant, and no matter what system of heating is
maintained, humidifiers must be used, the necessity for which
is doubled when the system is that of the hot-air furnace.</p>

<p>These shallow pans of water with large wick evaporating
surfaces will evaporate from three to four quarts during the
twenty-four hours. The humidity should be fifty throughout
the seasons of artificial heating.</p>

<p>Many colds may be entirely avoided by the use of humidifiers
or evaporators. The open grate is one of the very best means
of nursery heating. Gas and oil heaters should not be depended
upon for nursery heat. Only in an emergency should they be
used at all, and the electric heater is by far the best device
for such occasions.</p>

<h4>BABY'S CORNER IN MOTHER'S ROOM</h4>

<p>It is probably a conservative estimate to say that ninety-five
per cent of all the babies occupy a corner of mother's and
father's bedroom for the first two or three years. And believing
this estimate to be correct, it is advisable to give the matter
some consideration. To begin with, a lot of the non-essentials,
ruffles and fluffles of the average bedroom, must go. The good
father's chiffonier may have to be put in the bath room; heavy
floor coverings must be discarded, to be replaced by one or two
small, light-weight rugs; wall decorations and the usual bric-a-brac
of dressers, tables, etc., should be carefully packed away.
In fact, there should be nothing in the room save the parents'
bed, dresser (several drawers of which must be devoted to
baby's necessities), table, low rocker, a stool, baby's bed and a
good big generous screen, made out of a large clothes horse
enameled white and filled with washable swiss.</p>

<p>Window draperies must be taken down and packed away, while
they are replaced with simple muslin which can go to the
laundry twice a month. If it be within the means of the family
purse, it is well to renovate the walls just prior to the advent
of the little stranger.</p>

<p>And now the baby's bed is placed in the corner most protected
from draughts and the glare of the sunlight. If it can
be so arranged that baby looks away from the light, and not at
it, we are guarding it from defective vision in the future.</p>

<h4>CRIB SUBSTITUTES</h4>

<p>Many a beautiful artistic creation so much admired in this
world is found to be, on closer inspection, a very ordinary thing
which has received an artistic touch; and so, many convenient,
sanitary, and beautiful cribs are fashioned from market baskets
fastened to tops of small tables whose legs are sawed off a
bit; from soap boxes fastened to a frame, and from clothes
baskets. A can of white enamel, a paint brush and the deft
hand of a merry, cheery-hearted expectant mother can work
almost miracles. Remember, please, that all draperies must be
washable and attached with thumb tacks so as to admit of
easy and frequent visits to the laundry.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span></p>

<p>A medium-sized clothes basket will take care of our baby
for four or five months. The same general plan for the mattress
and bedding is followed as before described.</p>

<h4>EXTRA HEAT TO THE CRIB</h4>

<p>If necessary&mdash;and it usually is, especially during the winter
months&mdash;a hot-water bottle may be placed underneath the
bedding on top of the mattress. This insures a steady, mild,
uniform warmth and it not only saves the baby from the danger
of being burned, but it also obviates the temporary overheating
of the child which usually occurs when the bottle is placed
inside the bed, next to the baby. If the bed is properly made&mdash;the
blankets coming from under the babe up and over&mdash;there
is little or no need for extra heat for well babies after
the first month.</p>

<h4>LIGHTING BABY'S ROOM</h4>

<p>If electric lighting is not an equipment of the home neither
gas or oil lamps should be allowed to burn in the room for
long periods. For emergency night lighting a well-protected
wax candle should be used. However, don't go to sleep and
allow a candle to burn unprotected as did one tired, exhausted
mother. The father, suddenly aroused from his sleep, saw a
large flame caused by the overturning of a wax candle into
a box of candles, while the lace drapery of the basinet was within
a few inches of the flame and the baby just beyond. Grabbing a
pillow he smothered the flames and saved baby and all.</p>

<h4>FRESH AIR</h4>

<p>Plenty of fresh air and lots of sunshine should enter baby's
room. The large screen amply shields from draughts, and when
thus protected there need be no unnecessary concern about
cool fresh air, especially after two or three months, as it is
invigorating and prevents "catching cold." Warm, stuffy air
is devitalizing and even during the early weeks when the
fresh air must be warm, an electric fan should be advantageously
placed so that many times each day the warm fresh air may
be put in motion without creating a harmful draught.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span></p>

<p>Warm stuffy air makes babies liable to catch cold when taken
out into the open.</p>

<p>Throw open the windows several times each day and completely
change the air of baby's room. In the absence of the
large screen, a wooden board five or six inches high is fitted
into the opening made by raising the lower window sash. Then
as the upper sash is lowered the impure air readily escapes while
fresh air is admitted.</p>

<h4>THE BATH EQUIPMENT</h4>

<p>Make early preparations for bathing the baby in the easiest
possible manner; in fact, the young mother should seek to attend
to all her duties&mdash;the family, the home, and the baby&mdash;in the
easiest way. For the administration of a bath during the
early months, a table is needed, protected by oilcloth on which
is placed a roomy bathtub with a folded turkish towel on the
bottom for baby to sit on. In addition to the tub, have:</p>

<table border="0" width="100%" cellpadding="2" cellspacing="2" summary="Articles">

</table>

<p>See that the bathtub is clean and enamel unbroken, and if
it has been used by another babe, freshen it with a coat of
special enamel sold for that purpose.</p>

<h4>BATH TEMPERATURES</h4>

<tr><td align="left" valign="top">From six to twenty-four months</td><td align="right" valign="top">Temperature 90&mdash;97 F.</td></tr>
</table>

<p>A bath at ninety-eight degrees is a neutral bath, and after the
baby is six months and over, the bath may be given at this temperature,
and at the close quickly cooled to ninety degrees.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span></p>

<h4>NURSERY CLEANLINESS</h4>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The nursery should furnish the baby's first protection from
contagious diseases. It must be a veritable haven of safety. Therefore,
no house work of any kind should be done in the room, such
as washing or drying the baby's clothes. The floors and the furniture
should be wiped daily with damp cloths. A dry cloth or
feather duster should never be used to scatter dust around the room.</p></div>

<p>All bedding and rugs should receive their daily shaking and
airing out of doors, remembering that particles of dust are
veritable airships for the transportation of germs. In every
way possible avoid raising a dust. So much of the lint which
commonly comes from blankets may be avoided with the
daily shaking out of doors.</p>

<p>Soiled diapers should not accumulate in a corner or on the
radiator; their removal should be immediate, and if they must
await a more opportune time, soak them in a receptacle filled
with cold water. Even those diapers slightly wetted should
never be merely dried and used again, but should be properly
washed and dried. No washing soda should be used in the
cleansing of diapers&mdash;just an ordinary white soap, a good boil,
and plenty of rinse water, with drying in the sun if possible.
They require no ironing. Hands that come in contact with
soiled or wet diapers must be thoroughly cleansed before caring
for the baby or preparing his food.</p>

<p>As before mentioned, and it will bear repetition often, all
windows and doors must be well screened, for flies and mosquitoes
are dreaded foes in any community and in babyland in
particular. All used bottles and nipples as well as used cups,
pitchers, bits of used cotton, should be removed at once. The
washcloth is a splendid harbinger of germs. There should be
one for the face, and one for the body and bath, and both
should receive tri-weekly boiling. Bath towels should not be
used more than twice, better only once.</p>

<p>The technic of bathing, together with the location, furnishings,
and cleanliness of the baby's sick room, will be taken up
in later chapters.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV</h2>
<h2>WHY BABIES CRY</h2>
</div>

<p>It is surprising how soon even a young and inexperienced
mother will learn to distinguish between the <i>pain</i> cry and
the <i>plain</i> cry of her baby; for most crying can easily be traced
to some physical discomfort which can be relieved, or to some
phase of spoiling and indulgence which can be stopped.</p>

<h4>NORMAL HEALTHY CRYING</h4>

<p>The young baby can neither walk, talk nor engage in gymnastics,
except to indulge in those splendid physical exercises
connected with a good hearty cry. To be good and healthy,
an aggregate of an hour a day should be spent in loud and
lusty crying. He should be allowed to kick, throw his arms
in the air and get red in the face; for such gymnastics expand
the lungs, increase general circulation and promote the general
well-being of the normal child. As the child grows older and
is able to engage in muscular efforts of various sorts, these
"crying exercises" should naturally decrease in frequency
and severity. When baby cries, see that the abdominal band
is properly applied, that rupture need not be feared.</p>

<h4>THE BIRTH CRY</h4>

<p>The sound most welcomed by both doctor and nurse is the
cry of the newly born child, for it shows that the inactive lungs
have opened up and the baby has begun to use them, for all
the time baby was living in the uterine room he did not
breathe once, the lungs having been in a constant state of
collapse; and not until now, the very moment the air comes
in contact with his skin, do the lungs begin to functionate as
he emits his first lusty holler.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span></p>

<h4>ABNORMAL CRYING</h4>

<p>The cry is said to be abnormal when it continues too long
or occurs too often. It may be strong and continuous, quieting
down when he is approached or taken up; or it may be a worrying,
fretful cry, a low moan or a feeble whine. And now as
we take up the several cries, their description, cause, and
treatment, we desire to say to the young mother: Do not
yourself begin to fret and worry about deciding just which
class your baby's cry belongs to; for help, knowledge, and wisdom
come to every anxious mother who desires to learn and
who is willing to be taught by observation and experience.</p>

<h4>THE HUNGER CRY</h4>

<p>The continuous, fretful cry, accompanied by vigorous sucking
of the fists, both of which stop when hunger has been
satisfied, is without question the hunger cry.</p>

<p>If this cry is constant with regular feedings, then the quantity
of the food must be increased, or the quality improved.
The tired, fretful hunger cry must not be neglected; the cause
must be removed, for it points to malnutrition.</p>

<h4>THE CRY OF THIRST</h4>

<p>One day when lecturing at an Iowa chautauqua, I remained
in the beautiful park for the noonday meal. It was a warm
day and the tables in the well-screened dining tent were filled
with mothers who, like myself, preferred the cool shade of
the park to the hot ride through the city to the home or hotel
dinner. At my table a baby was pitifully crying. The mother
had offered the little child seated in a small uncomfortable
go-cart, milk, bread, and a piece of cake&mdash;all of which were
ruthlessly pushed aside. My little son, then only four and a
half, said "Mamma, maybe the baby's thirsty," and up he
jumped, hurried to the mother's side with his glass of water,
saying, "I haven't touched it, maybe the baby's thirsty." The
mother brushed the boy aside, saying, "No, I never give the
baby water." In spite of the mother's remonstrance, the baby
cried on and on, and finally on "trying" the water, the child
drank fully one-half the glass and the crying was hushed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span></p>

<p>Babies should be given water regularly&mdash;many times every
day&mdash;from birth, in varying amounts from two teaspoons
to one-half cup, according to the age of the child. The water
should be boiled for the first few months, and longer if there is
any suspicion of impurities.</p>

<p>Milk to the nursing infant is like beefsteak and potatoes to
the adult; and many times the milk bottle or the breast is just
as nauseating to the thirsty babe, as meat would be to the very
thirsty adult whose hunger has previously been fully satisfied.</p>

<h4>THE FRETFUL CRY</h4>

<p>The babe who is wet, soiled, too hot, or is wrapped too
tightly, or who has on a tight, uncomfortable belly band, or
whose clothing is full of wrinkles, has only one way to tell
us of his discomfort, and that is to cry. It is a fretful cry and
should command an immediate investigation as to the possible
cause. It takes but a moment to discover a wet diaper; to run
the hand up the back under the clothes; to sprinkle with talcum
if perspiring; to straighten out the wrinkled clothing; to find
the unfastened pin that pricks; or to loosen the tight band.
Acquire the art of learning to perform these simple tasks easily,
and any or all of these services should be rendered without
taking the child from its bed.</p>

<p>Let the child early learn to rest happily and quietly in his
own bed. The pillow or mattress may be turned or perhaps
the mattress be raised nearer the edge of the basinet. One
poor youngster instantly stopped his fretful cry when his mattress
was raised four or five inches so he could get the air, at
the same time taking him out of his hot room to a cooler room
with raised windows. Babies like cold air. They cry when the
air is hot, or even warm and close. Every day&mdash;rain or
shine, wind or sleet&mdash;babies should nap out of doors on the
porch, in a well-sheltered corner. A screen or a blanket protects
from the wind, sleet, or rain; and if the baby's finger tips are
warm, you can rest assured the feet and body are warm. Scores
of babies will sleep out on the porch, on the protected fire escape,
or in a room with opened windows, from one bottle or feeding
to another; being aroused at the end of the three or four hour<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
interval just enough to nurse, when back they go to their
delightful, warm nest in the cool, fresh air to sleep for another
period. Babies should never sleep in a room with closed
windows.</p>

<p>One of the incidents that surprised me most in my early
work with dispensary babies was the utter misconception of the
purpose of the belly band. Invariably it was put on so tightly
that I could not slip a finger between it and the babe. It is
not a surgical instrument, neither is it a truss. These tight
belly bands are a source of much fretting and crying.</p>

<h4>THE PAIN CRY</h4>

<p>The little pinched look about the face, the drawing up of the
legs, the jerking of the head, arms, or legs, associated with a
strong, sharp, unceasing or intermittent cry, demands immediate
attention Our first work should be to go about quietly,
painstakingly, and systematically to locate the cause of this
"cry of pain."</p>

<p>There are often some accompanying symptoms to the cry
of pain which demand skilled medical advice and attention,
such as the arching of the body backward, the drawing of the
head strongly to one side, the inability to use one side of the
body, or the presence of fever. There may be an earache, an
abdominal complication, or a sore throat, any one of which will
be detected by the skilled doctor.</p>

<p>Earache frequently occurs in young babies who have been
taken out of doors without proper protection to the ears; or,
it may be associated with a cold in the head, which is not
detected until the mischief has already been done, while the
resulting running ear tells the tale of woeful suffering. Earache
must always be thought of as a possible cause when the
cry of pain accompanies a cold in the head, and if medical aid
is secured early, the abscess may be aborted and the deafness
of later years entirely avoided. There is only one home remedy
for earache, and that is the application of external heat, either
by a hot-water bottle or hot-salt bag. Medical advice should
be sought before anything whatsoever is dropped into the baby's
ear.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span></p>

<p>In this connection should be mentioned the wild cry at night
which so often accompanies tuberculosis of the bone. A careful
X-Ray examination will reveal the disease, and proper
medical measures should be instituted at once. Other fretful
night crying will be mentioned further on.</p>

<h4>HABIT CRYING</h4>

<p>By the frequent repetition of actions, habits are formed.
When the baby is two or three days old, he is so new to us
and we have waited for him so long, and it is such a great
big world that he has come into, that we jump, dance, and
scramble to attend to his every need and adequately to provide
for his every want. At this very early, tender age whenever
he opens his mouth to cry or even murmur&mdash;some fond auntie
or some overly indulgent caretaker flies to his side as if she
had been shot out of a gun, grabs him up and ootsey tootsey's
him about as she endeavors to entertain and quiet him. The
next time and the next time and the succeeding time he whimpers&mdash;like
a flash someone dashes to the side of the basket,
and baby soon learns that when he opens his mouth and yells,
somebody comes. In less than a week the mischief has been
done and baby is badly spoiled. No other factor enters so
largely into the sure "spoiled" harvest as picking a new baby
up every time he cries. Often in the early days some indulgent
parent will say, "Oh, don't turn out the light, something might
happen to the dear little thing"&mdash;and old Mother Nature sees
to it that a constant repetition of "leaving the light on" brings
its sure harvest of "he just won't go to sleep without the light."
And then, "just once" he had the pacifier&mdash;perhaps to prevent
his crying disturbing some sick member of the family&mdash;and so
we go on and on. If a thing is bad, it is bad, and a supposedly
good excuse will not lessen the evil when the habit has been thus
started and acquired.</p>

<p>The rocking of babies to sleep may be a beautiful portrayal
of mother love, but we all pity the child who has to be rocked
to sleep as much as we do the mother who sits and rocks, wanting,
Oh, so much! to do some work or go for a walk&mdash;but
she must wait till baby goes to sleep.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span></p>

<h4>THE TEMPER CRY</h4>

<p>And so now we come to the temper cry&mdash;that lusty, strong
outburst of the cry of disappointment when he finds that all of
a sudden people have stopped jumping and dancing for his
every whim. The baby is not to blame. We began something
we could not keep up, and he&mdash;the innocent recipient of all
our indulgences&mdash;is in no sense at fault. It is most cruel to
encourage these habits of petty indulgence, which must cause
so much future disappointment and suffering on the part of the
little fellow as he begins to grow up.</p>

<p>Nobody is particularly attracted to the spoiled baby. After
the over-indulgent parent and caretaker have completed their
thoughtless work, they themselves are ashamed of it and not
infrequently begin to criticise the product of their own making&mdash;the
formation of these unpleasant bad habits. More than
anything else, the spoiled child needs a new environment, new
parents, and a new life.</p>

<h4>THE SPOILED BABY</h4>

<p>Seek to find out if possible&mdash;and it usually is possible&mdash;just
what he is crying for. It may be for the pacifier, for the light,
or to be rocked, jolted, carried, taken up and rocked at night,
or a host of other trifles; and if he is immediately hushed on
getting his soul's desire&mdash;then we know he is "spoiled."</p>

<p>The unfortunate thing about it all is that the one who has
indulged and spoiled the baby usually does not possess the
requisite nerve, grit, and will power to carry out the necessary
program for baby's cure. And the pity of it all is that overindulgence
in babyhood so often means wrecked nerves and
shattered happiness in later life. So, fond, indulgent parents,
do your offspring the very great kindness to fight it out with
them while they are young, even if it takes all summer, and
thus spare them neurasthenia, hysteria, and a host of other
evils in later life.</p>

<p>This sort of "spoiled baby crying" can be stopped only
through stern discipline&mdash;simply let the baby "cry it out."
The first lesson may require anywhere from thirty minutes to
an hour and thirty minutes. The second lesson requires a much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
shorter time, and, in normal babies with a balanced nervous
system, a third or fourth lesson is not usually required.</p>

<h4>THE CRY OF SERIOUS ILLNESS</h4>

<p>The cry of the severely sick child is the saddest cry of all.
The low wail or moan strikes terror to the saddened mother-heart.
It is often moaned out when the child is ill with "summer
complaint" or other intestinal disturbances. Instant help
must be secured, and, if medical help is not obtainable, remember,
with but one or two exceptions, you are safe in carefully
washing out the bowels, in applying external heat and giving
warmed, boiled water to drink.</p>

<p>Another cry which demands immediate attention, and the
faithful carrying out of the doctor's orders, is the hoarse,
"throaty" cry indicative of croup or bronchitis.</p>

<h4>THE COLICKY CRY</h4>

<p>Perhaps the greatest cause of the most crying during infancy,
next to that of over-indulgence, is ordinary colic which&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>... manifests itself in every degree of disturbance from mere
peevishness and fretfulness to severe and intensely painful attacks
in which restlessness passes into grunting, writhing, and kicking;
the forehead becomes puckered and the face has an agonized
expression; the baby tends to scream violently and draws his
thighs up against his belly, which will usually be found to be hard
and more or less distended.</p></div>

<p>A colicky baby completely upsets the household and greatly
disturbs the mother, who requires both quiet and rest that she
may the better produce the life-sustaining stream so much
needed for the upbuilding and development of the growing
child.</p>

<h4>COLIC IN THE BREAST-FED</h4>

<p>While colic is so often seen in the bottle-fed babe, it often
occurs in the breast-fed child, and is usually traceable to some
error in the mother's diet or to some other maternal nutritional
disturbance. One mother who was sure she had eaten nothing
outside the diet suggestions she had received, was requested to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
bring to the office a fresh voiding of her own urine which was
found to be highly acid. The administration of an alkaline
such as simple baking soda or calcined magnesia to the mother,
corrected this acidity, and the colic in the baby entirely disappeared.
I recall the case of one mother who ate her dinner
in the middle of the day, with a light meal in the evening and
thereby stopped the colic in her babe.</p>

<p>Another source of colic in the breast-fed baby is the unclean
nipple. The nipples should be washed with soap and water
and rinsed in boracic acid solution before each nursing. If
the mother worries greatly, or thoughtlessly "gets very angry"
just before the nursing hour, there is a substance known as
"epinephrin" secreted by the glands located just above the
kidneys which is thrown into the blood stream and which raises
the blood pressure of the mother and often produces not only
colic in the babe, but many times throws him into severe convulsions.</p>

<h4>COLIC IN BOTTLE-FED BABIES</h4>

<p>There are many opportunities for colic in the bottle-fed baby;
for instance, dirty bottles, dirty nipples, careless cleansing of
utensils used in the preparation of baby's food, improper mixtures,
too much flour, the wrong kind of sugar, too much cream
or too little water&mdash;all these things help to produce wind under
pressure in the intestine, which is commonly known as colic.
Underfeeding or overfeeding, too rapid feeding or too frequent
feeding also contribute their mite in producing colic.</p>

<p>As a rule, the bottle-fed child is fed too often. In the new
born, the interval between feeds should be three hours from
the start; after six months the interval may be lengthened to
four hours.</p>

<h4>COLIC AND CHILLINESS</h4>

<p>Hiccough&mdash;a spasm of the diaphragm&mdash;often accompanies
colic, and, in the case of infants, is usually due to the swallowing
of air or over-filling the stomach; gentle massage, external
heat, and a few sips of very warm water usually corrects the
condition.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span></p>

<p>The chilling of the skin very often produces a temporary
intestinal congestion with colic as the result. Cold feet, wet
diapers, and loitering at bath are all very likely to produce colic;
and when it is thus caused by chilling, quickly prepare a bath
at 100 F., and after immersing the child for five minutes, wrap
up well in warm blankets.</p>

<h4>THE TREATMENT OF COLIC</h4>

<p>Those of my mother readers who have electric lights in their
home, will find the photophore to be a source of great comfort
and convenience; for this simple contrivance is usually able
to banish colic in a few moments. The photophore is simply
radiant heat&mdash;heat plus light (See <a href="#illus-005">Fig. 3</a>)&mdash;and as this heat is
applied to legs and buttocks of the crying child the diaper is
warmed, the abdomen relaxes, gas is expelled, intestinal contractions
relieved, and the baby is soon fast asleep.</p>

<p>Occasionally with the aid of the photophore, and even without
it, the warm two-ounce enema containing a level teaspoon
of baking soda and a level teaspoon of salt to a pint of water
when allowed to flow into the bowel, will soon bring down
both gas and feces to the great relief of the baby. Warm water
to drink is also very helpful. Putting the feet in very warm
water is also quieting to the crying colicky babe.</p>

<p>It is often necessary in cases of repeated and persistent colic,
Do not jolt or bounce the baby, do not carry him about, and
don't walk the floor with him.</p>

<p>Heat him up inside and outside, warm his clothing and his
bedding, and thus bring about relief without sowing seeds for
future trouble&mdash;the sorrow of a spoiled child.</p>

<p>One very quiet little baby was one day brought to the dispensary
whose mother said: "Doctor, I didn't bring him 'cause
he's sick, but 'cause he looks so pale; he's as quiet as a mouse;
he never cries any more since I got to giving him medicine."
On examination of the baby and on inquiring about the medicine,
we found that the baby was dead drunk all the time. Some
"neighbor friend" had told the tired out mother, "Give him a
teaspoon of whiskey at each feeding and that'll fix him all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
right." If a few more states go dry maybe it will not be so
easy for the ignorant mother to dope and drug her helpless
baby.</p>

<p>And neither is paregoric to be administered wholesale for
colic. It contains an opiate, and should not be given without
definite orders from a physician. And so as a parting word on
"Why Babies Cry," we ask each mother to run over the following
summary of the chapter, and thus seek to find out why
her baby cries.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XV</h2>
<h2>THE NURSING MOTHER AND HER BABE</h2>
</div>

<p>Happy is the mother, and thrice blessed is the babe when
he is able to enjoy the supreme benefits of maternal nursing.
The benefits to the child are far reaching; he stands a better
chance of escaping many infantile diseases; the whole outlook
for health&mdash;and even life itself&mdash;is greatly improved in the
case of the nursing babe, as compared with the prospect of the
bottle-fed child. Maternal nursing lays the foundation for
sturdy manhood and womanhood.</p>

<p>Out of every one hundred bottle-fed babies, an average of
thirty die during the first year, while of the breast-fed babies,
only about seven out of every one hundred die the first year.
At the same time, nursing the babe delivers the mother from all
the work and anxiety connected with the preparation of the
artificial food, the dangers and risks of unclean milk, and the
ever-present fear of disease attendant upon this unnatural feeding.
The mother who nurses her child can look forward to a
year of joy and happiness; whereas, if the babe is weaned, she
is compelled to view this first year with many fears and forebodings.
Mother's milk contains every element necessary for
the growth and development of the child, and contains them
in just the proportions required to adapt it as the ideal food
for that particular child.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>A dirty baby, properly fed, will thrive. A baby deprived of
fresh air, but wisely fed, will survive and even develop into a strong
healthy man or woman. But the baby raised according to the latest
and most approved rules of sanitation and hygiene, if improperly
fed, will languish and die.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span></p>

<h4>HYGIENE OF NURSING MOTHERS</h4>

<p><i>Outings and Exercise.</i> It is most highly important that the
nursing mother should be able thoroughly to digest her food;
otherwise the flow of milk is likely to contain irritants that
will disturb the baby's digestion, even to the point of making
him really sick. In order to avoid these complications, exercise
and outings are absolutely essential for the mother. A vigorous
walk, gardening, light housework or other light athletics,
greatly facilitate digestion and increase the bodily circulation,
as well as promote deep breathing, all of which are of paramount
importance to a good appetite and good digestion.</p>

<p><i>The Bowels.</i> The bowels should move regularly and normally
once or twice during the twenty-four hours. Unfortunately,
this is not usually the case: and in this connection we would
refer our reader to the chapter on "The Hygiene of Pregnancy,"
particularly those sections relative to the care of the
bowels, recipes for bran bread, lists of laxative foods and other
suggestions pertaining to the hygiene of the nursing mother.</p>

<p><i>Sleep.</i> Nothing less than eight hours sleep will suffice for
the nursing mother, and during the day she should take at least
one nap with the baby.</p>

<p><i>Care of the Skin.</i> Salt-rub baths are very beneficial taken
once a week. The daily cold-friction rub described elsewhere,
will tone up the system and increase digestion and improve the
general well being. The soap wash may be taken once a week.
The thorough cleansing of the breasts, and the frequent changing
of the undergarments, will help to keep the baby happy;
for oftentimes it is the odor of perspiration as well as the smell
of soiled clothing that spoils the appetite of the baby, causing
it to refuse food.</p>

<p><i>Recreation.</i> Pleasant diversion is very essential for the
mother, and should be indulged in at least once a week. The
bedtime hours, however, should not be interfered with and the
recreation should be selected with a view to amuse, refresh
and create a harmless diversion for the mother's mind. Under
no circumstances should the mother settle down to the thought:
"No, I can't go out any more. I can't leave my baby." You<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
should get away from the baby a short time each day, and
go out among your former friends and acquaintances. Many
a wrecked home&mdash;a shattered domestic heaven&mdash;dates its
beginnings back to the days when the over-anxious young
mother turned her back on her husband and looked only into
the face of her (their) child. Nothing should come in between
the filial friendship of husband and wife, not even their child.
So, dear mother, if you can, go out occasionally, away from the
baby, and enjoy the association of your husband and keep in
touch not only with his interests, but with the outside world.
You will come back refreshed and wonderfully repaid, and the
face of the adored infant will appear more beautiful than ever.</p>

<h4>DIET OF THE NURSING MOTHER</h4>

<p>The general suggestions on diet which we made to the expectant
mother are also valuable for the nursing mother. The
food should be appetizing, nutritious, and of a laxative nature.
Three meals should be eaten: one at seven <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>, one at one <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>
and one about six-thirty at night, with the heaviest meal usually
at one <span class="smcap">p. m.</span> As the mother usually wakens at five o'clock, or
possibly earlier, she should be given a glass of milk, cocoa, or
eggnog. If she awakens at six, nothing should be taken until
the breakfast, which should consist of a good nourishing meal,
such as baked potatoes with white sauce, poached eggs, cereal,
milk or cocoa, prunes, figs, or a baked sweet apple, with bread
and butter, etc.</p>

<p>From that hour until one <span class="smcap">p. m.</span> only water is taken, and several
glasses are urged during this interval. With nothing between
meals but water and a little outdoor exercise, a good appetite
is created for the one <span class="smcap">p. m.</span> meal which should abundantly
supply and satisfy the hungry mother; and then again, nothing
is to be taken between dinner and supper but water. And after
the supper hour, a walk out into the cool night air should be
enjoyed with the husband and on going to bed about ten <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>,
an eggnog or glass of milk may be taken. At the close of the
other meals a cup of oatmeal gruel or milk or any other nourishing
liquid may be enjoyed.</p>

<p>The eating of food or the drinking of nourishing drinks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
between the meals not only interferes with digestion and disturbs
the mother, but it also upsets the baby; and it is often
the reason why the appetite of the mother is so deranged at
the meal time, her spirits depressed, and her milk diminished.
Plenty of good nourishing food, taken three times a day with an
abundance of water drinking between the meals, together with
a free happy frame of mind occasioned by the recreation before
mentioned, usually produces good milk and plenty of it. A nap
between meals will probably produce more milk than eating
between meals.</p>

<h4>OBJECTIONABLE FOODS</h4>

<p>All foods that cause indigestion in the mother or babe should
be avoided.</p>

<p>Some mothers continue to eat tomatoes, peaches, sour salads,
acid fruits, and it appears in no way to interfere with baby's
comfort; but they are the exception rather than the rule.
Usually tomatoes, acid salad dressings, and mixed desserts must
be avoided. Each mother is a law unto herself. Certainly
none of our readers will selfishly continue any food she feels
will make her baby cry. All acid fruits, rich desserts, certain
coarse vegetables, concoctions of all descriptions such as rarebit,
condiments, highly seasoned sauce, etc., should be avoided.</p>

<p>Acid fruitades, such as lemonade, limeade and orangeade, can
be taken by a small per cent of nursing mothers; and, since
fruit acids are neutralized and alkalized in the process of digestion
and assimilation, and since they are the very fruit-drinks
we prescribe for patients suffering with an increased acidity,
it would appear that they were in every way wholesome for the
mother&mdash;if they in no way interfere with the baby. Practically,
they do as a rule disturb the baby's digestion and should
be avoided by those mothers who have found this to be the
case.</p>

<h4>CAKED BREASTS</h4>

<p>During the first week of lactation the milk tubes of the
breasts very often become blocked and the breasts become engored
with milk, this condition being known as "caked<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
breasts." At this particular time of the baby's life, he takes
little more than an ounce of milk at a feed; so, beside the incoming
engorgement of milk, an additional burden is thrown
upon the milk tubes of the breasts in that they are not entirely
emptied each nursing time by the young infant. When the
breasts threaten to "cake," immediate steps must be taken to
relieve the condition&mdash;to empty the breasts&mdash;and this is
usually accomplished in the following manner: with hands well
lubricated with sweet oil or olive oil the nurse begins gentle
manipulation of the breasts toward the nipple in circular strokes,
with the result that the milk soon begins to ooze out. This
massage should be continued until relief is obtained; or the
breast pump may be applied. Hard nodules should not be
allowed to form or to remain in the breasts. Hot compresses
(wrung from boiling water by means of a "potato ricer")
may be applied to the caked breast which is protected from the
immediate heat by one thickness of a dry blanket flannel. These
hot compresses should be removed every three minutes until
three have been applied, then an ice water compress is quickly
applied, to be followed by more hot ones and then a cold;
and so on, until as many as four sets each have been administered.</p>

<p>Gentle massage may again be administered and it will be found
that they empty now with greater ease because of the preceding
heat. After the breasts have been emptied, and thoroughly
washed with soap suds and carefully dried, they should be
thickly covered with cotton batting and firmly compressed
against the chest wall by a snug-fitted breast binder, which
serves the double purpose of relieving pain by not allowing the
breasts to sag downward, at the same time preventing an over-abundant
secretion of milk by diminishing the blood supply to
the glands of the breast. In case the persistent manipulation
of the breast and the use of the breast pump do not relieve the
condition, and if the repeated effort day after day seems to
avail nothing; then, as a rule, we must look for a breast abscess
to follow if the breasts are not immediately "dried up." In all
such cases of engorgement, the attending physician should be
notified at once.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span></p>

<h4>SORE NIPPLES</h4>

<p>The nipple must be kept <i>dry</i> between nursings, which should
be limited to twenty minutes. Regularity should be maintained.
The nipples should never be touched or handled by
hands that have not been scrubbed with soap and a nail brush.
During the early nursing days they are wet much of the time
and are subject to much stress and strain in the "pulling effort"
of the baby, as a result of which they become very tender,
chapped, cracked, and often bleed. Allowing the baby to go to
sleep with the nipple in his mouth also exposes the nipple to
unnecessary moisture which increases the possibility of painful
cracking. The pain occasioned by nursing at this time is truly
indescribable, and is most often the cause of absolute refusal
on the part of the mother to nurse her babe&mdash;with the result
that it is put on the bottle. Again, the fear and dread of being
hurt so often tends to diminish the flow of milk. It is entirely
possible so to prepare the nipple for this exposure, during the
last months of pregnancy, that all this discomfort and pain may
be entirely avoided (See chapter, "<a href="#CHAPTER_IV">The Hygiene of Pregnancy</a>").</p>

<p>Before the mother is put to rest after the birth of the baby
the breasts are prepared as follows: A thorough cleansing
with soap and water is followed by a careful disinfection with
alcohol which leaves the nipple perfectly dry. A soft sterile
pad is then applied and held in place by a breast binder. Before
and after each nursing the nipple and surrounding area is
swabbed with boracic acid (saturated solution) and carefully
dried by applying a clean, dry, sterile pad.</p>

<p>Painful cracks and fissures are nearly always due to lack of
the care described above, and are almost wholly preventable.
When the first crack appears and nursing becomes painful, the
baby's mouth should not touch the nipple again until healing
has taken place. A thorough cleansing with boiled water should
be made and then the sterile nipple shield should be applied
through which baby will get abundant satisfaction, while the
mother is spared the pain, and the nipple has an opportunity to
get well.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span></p>

<p>In the case of sore and cracked nipples, thorough cleansing
with boiled water and boracic acid solution follows each nursing
seance; and, after careful drying, balsam peru&mdash;equal
parts with glycerine&mdash;may be applied with a tiny piece of
sterile gauze or cotton; a sterile cotton pad is then applied to
each breast which is held in place by a breast binder.</p>

<p>The nipple shield, when employed, is boiled after each nursing
and washed in boracic acid solution just before each
nursing. The strictest cleanliness must be observed, and then
we hope to bring relief and comfort to the mother, and effect
the saving of nature's best food for the baby.</p>

<h4>CONSTITUENTS OF MOTHER'S MILK</h4>

<p>Mother's milk&mdash;that wonderfully adaptable, ever-changing
food, so accurately and scientifically suited to the hourly and
daily needs of the growing child&mdash;is composed of five different
parts, totally unlike in every particular, and each part exactly
suited to the needs which it supplies. The cream of the milk,
as well as the lactose or sugar, builds up the fatty tissues of the
body as well as helps provide the energy for crying, nursing,
kicking, etc. The proteins (the curd of the milk) are exceedingly
important; they are especially devoted to building up the
cells and tissues of the body of the growing child. The salts
form a very small part of the baby's food, but an important one,
for they are needed chiefly for the bones and the blood. The
fats, sugars, proteins, and salts, taken together, form the solids
of mother's milk, and are held in solution in the proportion of
thirteen parts of solids to eighty-seven parts of water; which
so holds these solids in solution that the baby can digest and
assimilate these necessary food elements. The mother's milk
increases in strength day by day and month by month as the
baby grows, and is the only perfect infant food on earth.</p>

<h4>THE TIME OF THE FIRST FEEDING</h4>

<p>Soon after the birth of the baby the wearied mother seeks
rest&mdash;she usually falls into a quiet, restful slumber; the baby
likewise goes to sleep and usually does not awaken for several
hours. After six or eight hours the child is put to the breast<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
and he begins to nurse at once, without any special help. This
first nursing should be discontinued after four or five minutes,
while he is put to the other breast for the same length of time.</p>

<p>If there is difficulty in sucking, a bit of milk may be made
to ooze out on the clean nipple, while the baby's lips are pressed
to it, after which the nurse gently presses and rubs the breasts
toward the nipple. After the nursing, the nipples should be
elongated, if necessary, by rubbing, shaping, or breast pump.</p>

<p>The baby gets but little nourishment during the first two days,
but that which he does get is essential; for the colostrum&mdash;the
first milk&mdash;is highly laxative in nature and serves the
important purpose of cleaning out the intestinal tract of that
first tarry, fecal residue, the meconium. This early sucking
of the child accomplishes another purpose besides the obtaining
of this important laxative&mdash;it also reflexly increases the contractibility
of the muscles of the womb, which is an exceedingly
important service just at this time.</p>

<p>Should the mother or caretaker feel that baby will starve
before the milk comes, or that it is necessary to provide "sweetened
water;" let us assure them that nothing is needed except
what nature provides. Nature makes the babe intensely hungry
during these first two days, so that he will suck well, and if he
is fed sweetened water, gruel, or anything else, he will not
suck forcefully; and so nature's plan for securing extra or
increased uterine contractions and the stimulation of the breast
glands will be seriously interfered with.</p>

<h4>WATER DRINKING</h4>

<p>As soon as the new born babe is washed and dressed he is
given two teaspoons of warmed, boiled water; and this practice
is continued every two hours during the day, until as much
as two to four ounces of unsweetened water is taken by the tiny
babe during the twenty-four hours. Inanition fever&mdash;the fever
that sometimes follows a failure to give water to the new born
infant&mdash;is thus avoided. The bottle from which the water
is given should be scalded out each time, the nipple boiled, and
just before the "water nursing" the nipple should be swabbed
with boracic acid solution.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span></p>

<h4>REGULARITY IN FEEDING</h4>

<p>From earliest infancy the baby should be nursed by the
"clock," and not by the "squawk." Until he reaches his sixth-month
birthday, he is fed with unerring regularity every three
hours during the day. Asleep or awake he is put to the breast,
while during the night he is allowed to sleep as long over the
three-hour period as he will. Babies are usually nursed at
night: during the early weeks, at nine o'clock in the evening,
at midnight, and at six o'clock in the morning. After four
months all nursing after ten <span class="smcap">p. m.</span> may be omitted.</p>

<p>The baby is ordinarily allowed to remain at the breast for
about twenty minutes. He may often be satisfied with one
breast if the milk is plentiful; if not, he is given both breasts;
and may we add the following injunction? insist that nothing
shall go into your baby's mouth but your own breast milk and
warm or cool-boiled water; no sugar, whiskey, paregoric, or
soothing syrup should be given, no matter how he cries. Never
give a baby food merely to pacify him or to stop his crying; it
will damage him in the end. More than likely he is thirsty,
and milk to him is what bread and meat are to you, neither
of which you want when you are thirsty.</p>

<h4>POSITION OF MOTHER DURING THE NURSING</h4>

<p>A perfectly comfortable position during nursing for both
mother and babe is necessary for satisfactory results. During
the lying-in period the mother should rest well over on her side
with her arm up and her hand under her head, the other hand
supports the breast and assists in keeping the nipple in the baby's
mouth, as well as preventing the breast from in any way interfering
with baby's breathing. A rolled pillow is placed at the
mother's back for support.</p>

<p>After the mother leaves the bed, she will find a low chair
most convenient when nursing the baby, and if an ordinary
chair be used, she will find that a footstool adds greatly to her
comfort. Once during the forenoon and once during the afternoon
the nursing mother will find it a wonderful source of rest
and relaxation if she removes all tight clothing, dons a comfortable
wrapper, and lies down on the bed to nurse her babe;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
and as the babe naps after the feed, she likewise should doze
and allow mother nature to restore, refresh, and fit her for
restful and happy motherhood.</p>

<p>Worry, grief, fatigue, household cares, loss of sleep, social
debauches, emotional sprawls&mdash;all debilitate the mother, and
usually decrease the flow of milk.</p>

<h4>NURSING WHEN ANGRY AND OVERHEATED</h4>

<p>Overheating, irritability, and sudden anger, almost invariably
tend to raise the blood-pressure, which means the entry into
the blood stream of an increased amount of epinephrin, which
disturbs the baby greatly, often throwing him into convulsions
or other sudden, acute illness.</p>

<p>Menstruation often interferes with the nursing mother,
the milk becoming weaker at this time; however, if the infant
continues to gain and the mother feels comparatively well, no
attention need be paid to this fact.</p>

<p>Another pregnancy demands a drying up of the breast at
once, as the tax is too great on the mother.</p>

<h4>THE STOOLS</h4>

<p>The stools of the breast-fed baby do not require as much
attention as those of the bottle-fed child. In cases of constipation,
after four months, from one teaspoon up to one-half
cup of unsweetened prune juice may be given one hour before
the afternoon feed.</p>

<p>In instances of colic with signs of fermentation in the stool,
the mother may take several doses (under her physician's
orders) of common baking soda; or, if she is constipated, calcined
magnesia will usually right the condition. Nature's
mother milk is so beautifully adapted to the baby's needs that it
is the rule for baby to have perfectly normal stools.</p>

<h4>SYMPTOMS OF SUCCESSFUL NURSING</h4>

<p>A happy baby is a satisfied baby. He lies quietly in a sleepy,
relaxed condition if he has enough to eat, provided he is otherwise
comfortable and dry. He awakens at the end of two hours
and perhaps cries; but plain, unsweetened, warm, boiled water<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
quenches his thirst, and he lies content for another hour, when
he is regularly nursed. He gains on an average of about one
ounce a day.</p>

<h4>EARMARKS OF UNSUCCESSFUL NURSING</h4>

<p>Constant discomfort, vomiting, fretful crying, passing and
belching of gas, colicky pain, disturbed sleep, greenish stools
with mucus, are among the more prominent earmarks of unsuccessful
nursing. These symptoms appearing in a pale, flabby,
listless, indifferent or cross baby, with steady loss of weight
continued over a period of three or four weeks, point to "nursing
trouble;" which, if not corrected, will lead to that much
dreaded infantile condition&mdash;malnutrition.</p>

<p>Bolting of food or overeating results in vomiting and gas,
and thus interferes with normal nursing, as also may tongue-tie.
A condition in the mouth, medically known as "stomatitis,"
and commonly known as "thrush," often gives rise to a fretful
cry when nursing is attempted. In the first place, the baby cannot
"hold on" to the nipple; while, in the second place, it hurts
his inflamed mouth when he makes an effort to nurse.</p>

<p>Long continued nursing covering three-fourths of an hour
or more, seizing of the nipple for a moment and then discarding
it, apparently in utter disgust, are the earmarks of very
scanty milk supply and should receive immediate attention.</p>

<h4>AIDS TO THE MILK SUPPLY</h4>

<p>Believing that many more mothers than do so should nurse
their babies, we have carefully tabulated a number of aids to
the milk supply, which we hope will be most earnestly tried
before the baby is taken from the breast&mdash;for so many, many
more bottle-fed babies die during the first year than the breast
fed. The dangers of infection, the worry of the food preparation,
the uncertainty of results, all call for a most untiring
effort on the part of every doctor, nurse, and mother, in their
endeavors to secure maternal nursing. The following is a
summary of "aids to the milk supply:"</p>

<p>1. Regular periodical sucking of the breasts from the day of
baby's birth.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span></p>

<p>2. Systematic applications of alternate hot and cold compresses,
followed by massage to the breasts.</p>

<p>3. Three good nourishing meals each day, eaten with merriment
and gladness of heart.</p>

<p>4. A glass of "cream gruel," milk, cocoa, or eggnog at the
close of each meal, with a glass just before retiring.</p>

<p>5. Three outings each day in the open air.</p>

<p>6. Nurse the baby regularly and then turn its care over to
another, you seek the out of doors and engage in walking, rowing,
riding and other pleasurable exercise.</p>

<p>7. Take a daily nap.</p>

<p>8. You can bank on fretting and stewing over the hot cook
stove to decrease your milk. It seldom fails to spoil it.</p>

<p>9. Regular body bathing, with cold friction rubs to the skin.</p>

<p>10. A happy, carefree mental state. Nothing dries up milk
so rapidly as worry, grief, or nagging.</p>

<p>11. The administration, preferably in the early days, of
desiccated bovine placenta; although it may be given at any time
during the period of nursing.</p>

<h4>WHEN THE BABY SHOULD NOT BE NURSED</h4>

<p>As much as we desire maternal nursing for the babe, there
do occur instances and conditions which demand a change to
artificial feeding, such as the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>A new pregnancy.</li>
<li>Mothers with uncontrollable tempers.</li>
<li>Cases of breast abscess.</li>
<li>Prolonged illness of the mother with high fever.</li>
<li>Wasting diseases such as tuberculosis, Bright's disease,
heart disease, etc.</li>
<li>Maternal syphilis.</li>
<li>When maternal milk utterly fails, or is wholly inadequate.</li>
</ol>

<p>When a maternal anesthetic is to be administered, or in case
of inflammation of the breast or during a very short illness not
covering more than two or three days, then the breast pump
may be used regularly every three hours to both breasts; the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
baby may be artificially fed and then returned to the breast after
the effects of the anesthetic has worn off or the temperature
has been normal for twenty-four hours.</p>

<p>There may also appear definite indications in certain children
which make it imperative that the nursing child should early be
weaned. These manifestations of disordered nutrition and
failing health admonish us to put the baby on properly modified
milk, or to transfer it to a wet nurse.</p>

<p>These conditions are:</p>

<p>1. Progressive loss in weight.</p>

<p>2. A bad diarrhea of long standing; one which does not
yield to the usual remedies, at least not as long as the baby
continues to feed from the breast. These diarrheas are especially
serious when accompanied by a steady loss in weight.</p>

<p>3. Excessive vomiting accompanied by progressive loss in
weight.</p>

<h4>THE WET NURSE</h4>

<p>Because of the rarity of good, healthy wet nurses, it is always
better to attempt to feed the baby with scientifically modified
milk (not proprietary foods), good, clean, cow's milk properly
modified to suit the weight and age of the child. We put weight
first, for we prepare food for so many pounds of baby rather
than for the number of months old he is.</p>

<p>If modified food has failed and the best specialist within
your reach orders a wet nurse; she must have the following
qualifications:</p>

<ol>
<li>She must be free from tuberculosis and syphilis.</li>
<li>She should be between twenty and thirty years of age.</li>
<li>She should abstain from all stimulants.</li>
<li>She should be amiable, temperate, and should sense her
responsibility.</li>
</ol>

<p>If an unmarried mother of her first child is engaged as a
wet nurse, she should not be "stuffed" or allowed to overeat,
which is commonly the result of moving her from her lower
life into more comfortable surroundings, or given ale or beer
to increase her milk. She should continue her normal eating,
take light exercise, which does not mean the scrubbing of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
floors or doing the family washing, and live under the same
hygienic regime outlined for the nursing mother. Should she
be the mother of the second or third illegitimate child, then
she is quite likely to be mentally deficient and she should not
be engaged. Her own babe will have to be fed artificially as
very few mothers can endure the strain of two suckling children.</p>

<p>The baby's own mother should keep general supervision and
not turn her babe entirely over to the care of the wet nurse.
Remember always that no one in the wide world will ever
take the same mother interest in your offspring that can spring
from your own mother heart.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVI</h2>
<h2>THE BOTTLE-FED BABY</h2>
</div>

<p>In taking up the subject of the bottle-fed baby, we must
repeat that the only perfect baby food on earth is the milk
that comes from the breast of a healthy mother.</p>

<p>But sudden illness, accident, chronic maladies, or possibly
the death of the mother, often throw the helpless babes out into
a world of many sorts and kinds of artificial foods&mdash;foods
that are prepared by modifying cow's, ass', or goat's milk; foods
arranged by the addition to the milk of various specially prepared
cereals, albumens or malted preparations, otherwise known
as "proprietary foods." We shall endeavor, then, in this chapter
and in that on "the feeding problem," to lay down certain
general suggestions to both the nurse and the mother, which
may assist them in their effort to select the food which will
more nearly simulate nature's wondrous mother-food, and which
will, at the same time, be best suited to some one particular
baby.</p>

<h4>THE HOURLY SCHEDULE</h4>

<p>The normal baby, from birth to six months, should receive
properly prepared nourishment every three hours, beginning
the day usually at six <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>, the last feeding being at nine <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>
During the early weeks an additional bottle is given at midnight,
but this is usually discarded at four months, at which time the
last feeding should be given at about ten instead of at nine at
night.</p>

<p>Should the baby continue to awaken during the night before
six in the morning, unless he is under weight, a bottle of warm,
boiled, unsweetened water should be given.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span></p>

<h4>QUANTITY OF FOOD</h4>

<p>The quantity of food to be given is always determined by
the size of the baby's stomach, which, of course, depends somewhat
upon the age of the child; for instance, the stomach of
the average baby one week old holds about one ounce, while at
the age of three months the stomach holds five ounces; so it
would not only be folly to give two ounces at one week and
seven ounces at three months, but it would also be very detrimental
to the babe, causing severe symptoms due to the overloading
of the stomach.</p>

<p>Careful study of the size of the stomach at different ages in
infancy, together with the quantity of milk drawn from the
breast by a nursing baby, has led to the following conclusions
regarding the capacity of the baby's stomach:</p>

<tr><td align="left" valign="top">6 months&mdash;1 year</td><td align="right" valign="top">6&mdash;8 ounces</td></tr>
</table>

<h4>REFRIGERATOR NECESSITY</h4>

<p>It is highly important that the day's feedings be kept in a
cold place, free from the odors of other foods as well as free
from dust, flies, and filth. In order that this may be accomplished,
the well-protected bottles, each containing its baby-meal,
are placed in a covered pail containing ice and water.
This covered receptacle is now put in an ice box; and, in order
that our most economical reader&mdash;one who may feel that she
cannot afford to keep up the daily expense of the family refrigerator&mdash;may
herself prepare a simple home refrigerator, the
following directions are given (<a href="#illus-011">Fig. 9</a>).</p>

<h4>HOMEMADE ICE BOX</h4>

<p>Procure a wooden box about eighteen inches square and sixteen
or eighteen inches deep and put four inches of sawdust
into the bottom; now fill in the space between a ten-quart pail,
which is set in the middle of the box with more sawdust. A
cover for the box is now lined with two or three inches of
newspaper, well tacked on, and is fastened to the box by hinges.
We are now ready for the inside pail of ice, into which is
carefully placed the well-protected bottles of milk, all of which
is then set into the ten-quart pail in the box. Five cents worth
of ice each day will keep baby's food cool, clean, and provide
protection against the undue growth of germs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 9. Homemade Ice Box.</span>
</div>


<h4>PREPARING THE BOTTLE<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span></h4>

<p>At each feeding hour, one of baby's bottled meals is taken
from the ice box and carefully dipped in and out of a deep cup
of hot water. A very convenient receptacle is a deep, quart
aluminum cup, which may be readily carried about. The hot
water in the cup should amply cover the milk in the bottle
(<a href="#illus-012">Fig. 10</a>).</p>

<p>To test the warmth allow a few drops to fall on the inner
side of the arm, where it should feel quite warm, never hot.
A baby's clean woolen stocking is now drawn over the bottle,
which keeps it warm during the feeding. No matter how great
the danger of offending a fond grandparent or a much adored
friend never allow anyone to put the nipple in her mouth to make
the test for warmth of baby's food.</p>

<p>There are many contrivances, both electrical and alcoholic,
for heating baby's bottle, many of which are both convenient
and inexpensive.</p>

<h4>POSITION DURING FEEDING</h4>

<p>And now we realize that we are about to advise against the
time-honored injunction which has been handed down from
"Grandma This" and "Mother That" to all young mothers who
have lived in their neighborhoods: "My dear young mother,
if you can't nurse your precious infant, you can at least
'mother it' at the nursing time by holding it in your arms and
gently rocking it to and fro as you hold the bottle to its lips."
This so-called "mothering" has resulted in regurgitation,
belching, and numerous other troubles, as well as the formation
of the "rocking habit."</p>

<p>A young mother came running into my office one day saying:
"Doctor, it won't work, the food's all wrong; my baby is not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
going to live, for he throws up his food nearly all the time."
We arranged to be present when the next feeding time came
and watched the proceedings. A dear old friend had told her
"she must 'mother' her baby at the nursing time," and so she
had held the child in a semi-upright position as she endeavored
to hold the bottle as near her own breast as was possible. The
hole in the nipple was a bit large, which occasioned the subsequent
bolting of the food, and then to continue the "mothering"
she swayed him to and fro, all of which was interrupted suddenly
by the vomiting of a deluge of milk.</p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 454px; padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em">
<a name="illus-012" id="illus-012"></a>
<img src="images/fig10.png" alt="Fig. 10. Heating the Bottle." title="" width="454" height="404" /><br />
<span class="caption">Fig. 10. Heating the Bottle.</span>
</div>

<p>I drew the shade in an adjoining room, opened the windows,
and into a comfortable carriage-bed I placed the baby on his
side. Seating myself beside him I held the warm, bottled meal
as he nursed. Several times I took it from his mouth, or so
tipped it that "bolting" was impossible. Gradually, carefully,
and slowly, I took the empty bottle away from the sleepy
babe, and as I closed the door the mother said in anxious
amazement: "He won't forget I'm his mother if I don't hold<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
him while he nurses?" You smile as I smiled at this girl-mother's
thought; but, nevertheless there are many like her&mdash;anxious,
well-meaning, but ignorant.</p>

<p>The infant stomach is little more than a tube, easily emptied
if the baby's position is not carefully guarded after nursing.
No bouncing, jolting, patting, rocking, or throwing should take
place either just before, during, or immediately after meals.</p>

<h4>TIME ALLOWANCE FOR ONE FEEDING</h4>

<p>From twelve to twenty minutes is long enough time to spend
at a bottle meal. The nipple hole may have to be made larger,
or a new nipple with a smaller hole may have to be purchased.
When new, you should be able to just see a glimmer of light
through the hole, and if the infant is too weak to nurse hard,
or the hole too small, it may be made larger by a heated hatpin
run from the inside of the nipple out; great care must be taken,
else you will do it too well. If the nipple hole is too large, bolting
is the sure result; while too small a hole results in crying and
anger on the part of the hungry child, because he has to work
too hard to get his meal.</p>

<h4>AFTER THE FEED</h4>

<p>We have seen some mothers, in their anxiety to prevent the
sucking in of air from the emptied bottle, rush in and jerk
the nipple from the going-to-sleep babe so forcibly that all
thoughts of sleep vanished and a crying spell was initiated.
The tactful mother is the quiet one who slowly, quietly, draws
the empty bottle with its "much loved nipple" from the lips.
If you observe that the babe is going to sleep, with an occasional
superficial draw at the nipple, wait a moment; he will
drop it himself, and you can pick it up as you quietly leave
the room. In all instances, whether it be indoors or out of doors,
arrange the babe in a comfortable sleeping position, remembering
that nursing is warm exercise and the babe gets uncomfortably
sweaty if overbundled, especially about the head and
neck. No one should unnecessarily touch the babe immediately
after feeding; even his diaper may be changed without awakening
him while he is thus lying quietly in his bed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span></p>

<h4>INTERVALS BETWEEN MEALS</h4>

<p>The three-hour interval is reckoned from the beginning of
the meal, and not from its close. More than two hours is
spent in the stomach digestion, and any food or sweetened
water which may enter between meals only tends to cause
indigestion and other disturbances. And that this important
organ may have a bit of rest, we fix the interval at three hours,
which in our experience and that of many other physicians, has
yielded good results. As a rule we have no regurgitation and
no sour babies on the three-hour schedule. Sick babies, very
weak babies, and their feeding time, will be discussed in a
later chapter.</p>

<h4>ADDITIONAL FOODS</h4>

<p>At six months, and often as early as four, in cases of constipation,
unsweetened, well-strained prune juice may be given,
beginning with one-half teaspoon one hour before the afternoon
feed and increasing it daily until two tablespoons are
taken. At six months, both orange juice and vegetable broths
are given, whose vegetable salts add a very important food
element to the baby's diet&mdash;an element which our grandmothers
thought could only be obtained through the time-honored "bacon
rind" of by-gone days.</p>

<p>Orange juice is also unsweetened and well strained, and is
administered in increasing amounts, beginning with one-half
teaspoon one hour before the afternoon feeding, until the
juice of a whole orange is greedily enjoyed by the time of the
first birthday. The vegetable juices are obtained from cut-up
spinach, carrots, tomatoes, and potatoes, strained, with a flavor
of salt and onion&mdash;really a bouillon&mdash;and is given just before
the bottle at the six <span class="smcap">p. m.</span> feeding. They are also begun in
teaspoon amounts.</p>

<h4>FOOD FOR THE TRAVELING BABE</h4>

<p>Baby travel should be reduced to a sheer necessity; never
should the babe be subjected to the exposure of disease germs, the
change of food, the possibilities of draughts and chilling, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
merely a pleasure trip&mdash;the risks are too great and the possibilities
of future trouble too far reaching.</p>

<p>If you are in touch with the milk laboratory of a large city,
you will find that they make a specialty of preparing feedings
which are good for a number of days for the traveling baby,
and we strongly advise that their preparations be accepted; but
in the event of not being in touch with such a laboratory we
suggest the making of a carrying ice-box covered with wicker,
which must be kept replenished with ice. Food kept in such
a device may be kept fresh for twenty-four to forty-eight hours.
Plans other than the laboratory preparations or the ice-box
are risky, and should not be depended upon.</p>

<p>Many of our railway dining cars now pick up fresh, certified
milk at stations along the line for use on their tables, and
where such is the case fresh preparations of milk may be made
on a trans-continental trip by the aid of an alcohol stove.
Malted milk may also be used, provided you have accustomed
the baby to its use a week before leaving home, by the gradual
substitution of a fourth to a half ounce each day in the daily
food; all of which, of course, should be done under your
physician's direction.</p>

<p>If possible, leave baby at home in his familiar, comfortable
environment in the care of a trained nurse and a trusted relative,
and under the supervision of the baby's own physician. He
is much better off, much more contented, and we are all aware
of the fact that contentment and familiarity of sights and
people promote good appetite, good digestion, and happiness&mdash;the
very essentials of success in baby feeding. We speak
touchingly and sympathetically to the mother who must leave
her babe; and likewise we wish to cheer her as we remind her
that by wireless messages and night letters it is possible to
keep in touch with loved ones though a thousand miles away.</p>

<p>The sanitation and modification of cow's milk, as well as
stools, etc., are taken up in later chapters.</p>

<h4>RULES FOR THE BOTTLE-FED</h4>

<p>1. Never play with a baby during or right after a meal.</p>

<p>2. Lay the baby on his side when nursing the bottle.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span></p>

<p>3. Three full hours should intervene between feedings.</p>

<p>4. Don't give the food too hot&mdash;it should just be warm.</p>

<p>5. Make the test for warmth on the inner side of your arm.</p>

<p>6. Give a drink of water between each meal if awake.</p>

<p>7. Never save the left-overs for baby.</p>

<p>8. If possible, give three feedings each day in the cool air,
with baby comfortably warm.</p>

<p>9. Do not jump, bounce, pat, or rock baby during or after
meals.</p>

<p>10. Never coax baby to take more than he wants, or needs.</p>

<p>11. No solid foods are given the first year.</p>

<p>12. Orange juice may be given at six months; while, after
four months, unsweetened prune juice is better than medicine
for the bowels.</p>

<h2>MILK SANITATION</h2>
</div>

<p>Cow's milk, like mother's milk, is made up of solids and
water. In a previous chapter we learned that in one-hundred
parts of mother's milk, eighty-seven parts were water
and thirteen parts were solid. These thirteen parts of solids
consist of sugar, proteins, and salts; this is likewise the case
with cow's milk, except that in the case of the cow's milk, the
sugar is decreased while the proteins are increased as will be
noted by the accompanying comparative analysis:</p>

<p>Mother's milk is absolutely sterile, that is, free from the
presence of germs; on the other hand, cow's milk is anything
but sterile&mdash;the moment it leaves the udder it begins to accumulate
numerous bacteria, all of which multiply very rapidly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
Cow's milk is generally twenty-four to forty-eight hours old
before it can possibly reach the baby. It is just as important
to keep in mind these facts of milk contamination&mdash;dirt, filth,
flies, and bacteria&mdash;as it is to plan for the modification of cow's
milk for the purpose of making it more nearly resemble
mother's milk. While mother's milk has about the same percentage
of fat as cow's milk, it is almost twice as rich in sugar,
and has only one-fourth to one-third as much protein. This
protein is vastly different from that found in cow's milk, which
you recall has a tough curd, as seen in cottage cheese. While
mother's milk contains a small amount of casein similar to that
found in the cheese of the cow's milk, the principal protein
constituent is of another kind (lactalbumin), and is much more
easy of digestion than the casein of cow's milk.</p>

<p>This is a most important point to remember, because the
baby's stomach is not at first adapted to the digestion of the
heavier and tougher protein curds of cow's milk. It requires
time to accustom the infant stomach to perform this heavier
work of digestion. There are a number of factors which must
be borne in mind in the modification of milk, whether it be
cow's milk, or goat's milk (for many European physicians use
goat's milk entirely in the artificial feeding of infants): namely,
the cleanliness of the milk, the acidity of milk, the difference
in the curd, the percentage of sugar, and the presence of
bacteria.</p>

<h4>SUGAR</h4>

<p>In the modification of cow's milk, sugar must be added to
make up for the sugar which is decreased when the water was
added to reduce the protein. There are several sorts of sugar
used in the modification of milk. These sugars are not added
to sweeten the milk alone, but to furnish a very important
element needed for the growth of the baby. Sugar is the one
element which the infant requires in the largest amount.</p>

<p>Milk sugar is probably most universally used in the modification
of milk, but a good grade of milk sugar is somewhat
expensive, costing from thirty to sixty cents a pound, and this
places it beyond the reach of many mothers. It is added to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
the food mixtures in the proportion of one ounce to every
twenty ounces of food. Cane sugar (table sugar) may also
be used, but it must be clean and of good quality. It is used
in rather less quantity than that of milk sugar, usually from
one-half to one-third of an ounce by measure to each twenty
ounces of food. Dextri-maltose (malt sugar) is very easy of
digestion and may be used in the modification of milk. Maltose
seems to help the children to gain more rapidly in weight than
when only milk or cane sugar is used. It is also exceedingly
useful in constipation, as its action is more laxative than any
of the other sugars; but it should not be given to children who
vomit habitually or have loose stools.</p>

<h4>ACIDITY</h4>

<p>Like mother's milk, the cow's milk is neutral as it comes
from the udder; but, on standing, it quickly changes, soon
becoming slightly acid, as shown by testing with blue litmus
paper. In fact, what is known as ordinarily fresh milk, if subjected
to the litmus paper test, always gives an acid reaction.
This acidity is neutralized by adding lime water to the formula
in the proportion of one ounce to each twenty-ounce mixture.
Ordinary baking soda is sometimes prescribed by physicians in
place of the lime water. In the event of obstinate constipation,
milk of magnesia is sometimes added to the day's feedings.</p>

<h4>CREAM</h4>

<p>There may be procured in any large city an instrument called
the cream gauge, which registers approximately (not accurately)
the richness of milk. Some milk, even though rich,
parts with its cream very slowly; while some poor milk allows
nearly all the cream quickly to rise to the surface. We know
of no way for the mother to determine the amount of cream
(without the cream gauge) except by the color and richness of
the milk. In cities it is very convenient to send a specimen
of the milk to the laboratories to be examined by experts, who
will gladly render a report to both physician and mother.</p>

<p>The lactometer is a little instrument used to estimate the
specific gravity of milk. An ordinary urinometer such as used
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>by physicians in estimating the specific gravity of urine may
also be used. The specific gravity of cow's milk should not
register below 1028 or above 1033.</p>

<h4>HERD MILK</h4>

<p>Milk from a single cow is not to be desired for baby's food
because of its liability to vary from day to day, not to mention
the danger of the cow's becoming sick. Authorities have
agreed that herd milk of Holstein or ordinary grade cows is
best for infant feeding. This mixed-herd milk contains just
about the proper percentage of fat; whereas, if Jersey milk
must be used, some of the cream should be taken away. Our
milk should come from healthy cows which have been tested
for tuberculosis at least every three months.</p>

<p>Annatto is sometimes added to milk to increase its richness
of color. To test for annatto proceed as follows: To a couple
of tablespoons of milk add a pinch of ordinary baking soda.
Insert one-half of a strip of filter paper in the milk and allow
it to remain over night. Annatto will give a distinct orange
tint to the paper. The commonly used milk preservatives are
boracic acid, salicylic acid, and formaldehyde, any of which
may be readily detected by your health officials.</p>

<h4>SANITARY DAIRIES</h4>

<p>In close proximity to most large cities there is usually to be
found one or more sanitary dairies. It is a joy indeed to visit
a farm of this kind with its airy stables and concrete floors,
which are washed with water coming from a hose. The drainage
is perfect&mdash;all filth is immediately carried off (<a href="#illus-013">Fig. 11</a>).
The cows are known to be free from tuberculosis, actinomycosis
(lumpy jaw), and foot and mouth disease. The milkmen on
this farm wear washable clothes at the milking time, and their
hands are painstakingly cleansed just before the milking hour.
Previous to the milking the cattle have been curried outside
the milking room and their udders have received a careful
washing. The milkman grasps the teat with clean hands, while
the milk is allowed to flow through several thicknesses of
sterilized gauze into the sanitary milking pail. This milk is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
at once poured into sterile bottles, is quickly cooled and shipped
in ice to the substations where the delivery wagon is waiting.
In the ideal delivery wagon there are shallow vats of ice in
which the bottles are placed, thus permitting the milk to reach
the baby's home having all the while been kept at a temperature
just above the freezing point.</p>

<p>And why all this trouble? Why all this worry over temperature
and cleanliness? Babies were not so cared for in the days
of our grandmothers. The old-fashioned way of milking the
cows with dirty clothes and soiled hands, while cattle were more
or less covered with manure, with their tails switching millions
of manure germs into the milking pail, produced a milk laden
not only with manure germs&mdash;the one great cause of infantile
diarrhea&mdash;but also swarming with numerous other mischief
making microbes. Even tuberculosis, that much dreaded disease
germ of early infancy, may come from the dairy hands as well
as from infected cows.</p>

<p>There used to be many dairymen like the old farmer who,
when interrogated by the health commissioner concerning the
cleanliness of his milk, laughed as he reached down into the
bottom of a pail of yellow milk and grabbing up a handful of
manure and straw, said: "That's what makes the youngsters
grow." But it does not make them grow; it often causes them
to die, and even if they do live, they live in spite of such contaminated
food, for the germ which is always found in the
colon of the cow (<i>coli communis</i>), probably kills more babies
every year than any other single thing.</p>

<p>It is possible to reduce the growth of these germs by keeping
the milk at a very low temperature from the time it leaves the
cow until the moment it gets to the home refrigerator. Those
which survive this process of refrigeration may be quickly
rendered harmless by pasteurizing or sterilizing at the time
of preparing baby's food.</p>

<p>In the absence of the modern sanitary dairy, we would suggest
that the milk supply be improved by giving attention to the
following:</p>

<p>The cattle should be tested for tuberculosis every three
months. The walls of the cowhouse should be whitewashed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
three times a year. The manure should be stored outside the
barn. The floor of the cowhouse should be sprinkled and swept
each day. The cattle should be kept clean&mdash;curried each day,
and rubbed off with a damp cloth before milking. The udders
should be washed before each milking. The milker can wear
a clean white gown or linen duster which should be washed
every two days, while his hands should be washed just before
the milking. The milking pail should be of the covered sanitary
order. The barn should be screened.</p>

<h4>CERTIFIED MILK</h4>

<p>Immediately after leaving the cow, the milk should be cooled
to at least 45 F. It should at once be put into bottles that have
been previously sterilized and then be tightly covered, and
should be kept in ice water until ready for consumption. No
matter how carefully the milk is handled, it is infected with
many bacteria, but if it is quickly cooled, the increase of the
bacteria is greatly retarded. Under no circumstances buy milk
from a grocery store out of a large can. Go to your health
officer and encourage him in his campaign for sanitary dairies
and certified milk.</p>

<p>Such milk as we have described under the head of sanitary
dairies, when it has been tested by the board of health and has
received the approval of the medical profession, is known as
"certified milk;" and, although the price is usually fifteen to
twenty cents a quart, when compared with the cost of baby's
illness it will prove to be cheaper than the dirty milk which
sickens and kills the little folks.</p>

<p>There is no doubt that the increased use of "certified milk"
has been a great factor in the reduction of deaths from infant
diarrhea in recent years.</p>

<h4>BOILING THE MILK</h4>

<p>When certified milk cannot be had, it is absolutely dangerous
to give raw, unboiled, or unpasteurized milk to the baby, particularly
in warm weather; for the countless millions of manure
germs found in each teaspoon of ordinary milk not only disturbs
the baby's digestion, but actually makes him sick, causing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
colic, diarrhea, and cholera infantum. The only way this milk
can be rendered safe is by cooking it&mdash;actually killing the
bacteria. This process of boiling, however, does not make good
milk out of bad milk nor clean milk out of that which is dirty,
it simply renders the milk less dangerous.</p>

<p>There are two methods of killing bacteria&mdash;sterilization and
pasteurization. By sterilization is meant the process of rendering
the milk germ free by heating, by boiling. Many of the
germs found in milk are comparatively harmless, merely causing
the souring of milk; but other microbes are occasionally present
which cause serious diseases, such as measles, typhoid and
scarlet fever, diphtheria, tuberculosis, and diarrhea. It is always
necessary to heat the milk before using in warm weather, and
during the winter it is also important when infectious or contagious
diseases are prevalent.</p>

<p>Milk should be sterilized when intended for use on a long
journey, and may be eaten as late as two or three days afterward.</p>

<p>To sterilize milk, place it in a well-protected kettle and allow
to boil for one hour and then rapidly cool. This process renders
it more constipating, and for some children many of its nutritive
properties seem to be destroyed, as scurvy is often the result
of its prolonged use. When a child must subsist upon boiled
milk for a long period, he should be given the juice of an
orange each day. Children are not usually strong and normal
when fed upon milk of this character for indefinite periods.
All living bacteria (except the spores or eggs) may be destroyed
by boiling milk for one or two minutes.</p>

<h4>PASTEURIZATION</h4>

<p>When baby is to use the milk within twenty-four hours,
"pasteurization" is better than boiling as a method of destroying
microbes.</p>

<p>There are many pasteurizers on the market which may be
depended upon, among which are the Walker-Gordon Pasteurizer,
and Freeman's Pasteurizer; but in the absence of either
of these pasteurization may be successfully accomplished by the
following method:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span></p>

<p>On the bottom of a large kettle filled with cold water, place
an ordinary flatiron stand upon which is put a folded towel.
On this place the bottle of milk as it comes from the dairyman,
with the cap of the bottle loosened. The cold water in the
kettle should come up to within an inch of the top of the bottle
of milk. Heat this water quickly up to just the boiling point&mdash;until
you see the bubbles beginning to rise to the top. The gas
is then turned down or the kettle is placed on the back of the
range and held at this near-boiling point for thirty minutes,
after which it is taken to the sink and cold water is turned
into the water in the kettle, until the bottle of milk is thoroughly
cooled. It is now ready to be made up into the modified food
for baby.</p>

<p>Never let pasteurized milk stand in the room, nor put it near
the ice when warm. It must be cooled rapidly, as described
above; that is, within fifteen or twenty minutes.</p>

<p>The "spores" of the milk are not killed by pasteurization
and they hatch out rapidly unless the milk is kept very cold,
and, as already stated, it should be used within twenty-four
hours after pasteurization.</p>

<h4>THE CARE OF BOTTLED MILK</h4>

<p>The certified milk or the ordinary milk that has been delivered
to your home and is to be used without pasteurization or sterilization,
should receive the following care:</p>

<p>1. It should be placed at once in a portion of the ice box that
is not used to store such foods as radishes, cabbage, meats or
any other open dishes of food whose odors would quickly be
absorbed by the milk. The milk should never be left standing
on the doorsteps in the sun, for many reasons: the sun heats
the milk, encourages the growth of bacteria, and a passing cat
or dog, whose mouth often contains the germs of scarlet fever,
tonsilitis, and diphtheria, should it be hungry, laps the tops of
the bottles, particularly in the winter when the cream has
frozen and is bulging over the edge.</p>

<p>2. It should never be kept in the warm kitchen, as when
visiting her sick baby we discovered one young mother doing.
In answer to my question, she explained; "Doctor, we do not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
take ice in the winter time, everything is ice outdoors, so I
just set the bottle outside the window bringing it in whenever
I need to give the baby some food. I forget to put it out sometimes,
but really now, does it matter?" It really matters much,
for you see, reader, the milk is first freezing then thawing
and it is rendered entirely unfit for the baby.</p>

<p>3. Milk should be kept covered and protected from dust and
flies; it should be kept in glass jars which have been sterilized
by boiling before being filled, and then placed in the refrigerator.
If the milk is sour, or if there is any sediment in the
bottle, it is unfit for baby's use.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XVIII</h2>
<h2>HOME MODIFICATION OF MILK</h2>
</div>

<p>In a previous chapter it was found from comparing the
analysis of mother's milk with that of cow's milk, that
they widely differed in the proteins and sugar. The art of so
changing cow's milk that it conforms as nearly as is possible
to mother's milk is known as "modification." Where protein,
sugar, and fat are given in proper amounts, healthy infants get
along well; but when either the fats or proteins are given in
excess, or when the digestion of the child is deranged, there is
often no end of mischief.</p>

<p>There are two groups of milk formulas that are useful. First,
those in which the fats and proteins are about the same, known
as "whole milk," or "straight" milk mixtures; second, those
in which the fats are used in larger proportions than proteins,
and known as "top milk"&mdash;milk taken from the upper part
of the bottle after the cream has risen. And since the larger
proportion of babies take the lower fats or "whole milk"
formulas, and seem to get along better than the babies who
have the "top milk" formulas, we will first take up the consideration
of the modification of whole milk.</p>

<h4>PREPARATION FOR MODIFICATION</h4>

<p>To begin with, everything that comes in contact with the
preparation of baby's food must be absolutely clean. The table
on which the articles are placed, and any towel that comes in
contact with the articles or the mother's hands, or those of the
nurse, must be thoroughly scrubbed.</p>

<p>There is only one way to prepare the utensils that are to be
used in making the baby's food, and that is to put them in a
large kettle and allow them to boil hard for fifteen minutes<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
just before they are to be used. The articles needed are (<a href="#illus-014">Fig. 12</a>):</p>

<h4>BOTTLES AND NIPPLES</h4>

<p>There is but one bottle which can be thoroughly washed
and cleaned, and that is the wide-mouthed bottle. It should
hold eight ounces and should have the scale in ounces blown
in the side (<a href="#illus-012">Fig. 10</a>). The nipple for this bottle is a large,
round breast from which projects a short, conical nipple, which
more nearly resembles the normal breast than do the old-fashioned
nipples so frequently seen on the small-necked nursing
bottles. There is a great advantage in this, in that the baby
cannot grasp the nipple full length and thus cause gagging.
These bottles and nipples are known as the "Hygeia," and
have proven to be a great source of comfort to the baby as
well as to the mother or nurse whose duty it is to keep them
clean. There are a number of other nursing bottles on the
market, which, if they are used, must be thoroughly cleansed
with a special bottle brush each day. The neck is small and
the nipple is small and great care must be taken in the cleansing
of both of them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span></p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 12. Articles Needed for Baby's Feeding.</span>
</div>

<h4>CARE OF BOTTLES AND NIPPLES</h4>

<p>When there is a bottle for each individual feeding in the day,
immediately after each nursing both bottle and nipple should
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>be rinsed in cold water and left standing, filled with water,
until the bottles for one day's feeding have all been used. The
nipples should be scrubbed, rinsed, and wiped dry and kept by
themselves until their boiling preparation for the following
day's feeding.</p>

<p>If the same bottle is to be used for the successive feedings
during the day, it should be rinsed, washed with soap and
water, and both bottle and nipple placed in cold water and
brought quickly to the boiling point and allowed to boil for
fifteen minutes. No bottles or nipples must ever be used after
a mere rinsing; boiling, preceded by a thorough washing in
soap and water, must take place before they are used a second
time.</p>

<p>New nipples are often hard and need to be softened, which is
readily done by either prolonged boiling or rubbing them in
the hands.</p>

<p>All new bottles should be annealed by placing them on the
stove in a dishpan of cold water and allowing them to boil
for twenty minutes, and then allowing them to remain in the
water until they are cold. When bottles are treated in this
manner they do not break so readily when being filled with
boiling water or hot food.</p>

<h4>PREPARING THE FOOD</h4>

<p>In a large preserving kettle place all the utensils needed in
the preparation of the food&mdash;pitcher, spoon, fork, measuring
glass, bottles, nipples, cheesecloth for straining, agate cup, wire
strainer, in fact everything that is to be used in the preparation
of the food. Now fill the kettle with cold water and place over
the gas and allow to boil for fifteen minutes. On a well-scrubbed
worktable place a clean dish towel, and on this put the
utensils and the bottles right side up. The nipples on being
taken out of the boiling water will dry of themselves; they
should be placed in a glass-covered jar until they are needed
for each individual feeding, the nipples not being placed on the
bottles as they go to the ice box.</p>

<p>Having been given your formula by your physician, proceed
in the following way. Suppose we were preparing the food<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
for a normal two-months old baby that weighed ten pounds,
with the prescription as follows:</p>

<h4>DETAILS OF PREPARATION</h4>

<p>Two level tablespoons of cane sugar are placed in the agate
cup and dissolved in a small amount of boiling water. The
solution should be perfectly clear, and if it does not clear up
put it over the heat for a few moments.</p>

<p>This is now turned into the eight-ounce measuring glass
which is then filled with boiling water and emptied into the
two-quart pitcher. We need four and one-half more ounces of
boiling water to complete the prescription requirement of twelve
and one-half ounces.</p>

<p>The bottle of milk, if properly certified, need not be pasteurized;
but if it is not, it should have been previously pasteurized
while the utensils were boiling according to the suggestions
found in the chapter on "milk sanitation." The top of the
milk bottle should be thoroughly rinsed and wiped dry, and
after a thorough shaking of the milk, the cover is removed with
the sterile fork and eleven ounces are measured out by measuring
glass and poured into the pitcher. All is now stirred
together with an ounce of lime water, which should never look
murky, but should be as clear as the clearest water and should
always be kept in the ice box when not in use.</p>

<p>The sterile cheesecloth which has been boiled for fifteen
minutes is now put over the nose of the pitcher, the contents
of which is accurately measured into the seven clean, empty
bottles, each containing three and one-half ounces. Over the
top of each of the nursing bottles is placed a generous piece of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
waxed paper which is held down by a rubber band. Each meal
for the day is now contained in a separate bottle, and all are
placed in a covered pail of water containing ice, and put in the
ice box.</p>

<p>If the prescription for the baby's food contains gruel, it is prepared
in the following manner:</p>

<p>Suppose the baby is eight months old and the prescription
called for two level tablespoons of flour and eight ounces of
boiled water. The two level tablespoons of flour, whether it
be wheat (ordinary bread flour), or barley flour, are put into
a cup and stirred up with cold water, just as you would stir up
a thickening for gravy; now measure out eight ounces of water
and allow it to come to a boil in the inner pan of the double
boiler, into which the thin paste is stirred until it comes to a
boil. After boiling for twenty minutes, remeasure in the measuring
glass and what water has been lost by evaporation must be
added to complete accurately the prescription requirement of
eight ounces; this is now added to the other ingredients of the
prescription.</p>

<h4>TABLE FOR INFANT FEEDING</h4>

<p>We now offer a monthly schedule&mdash;a table which is the
result of our experience in feeding hundreds of babies in various
sections of Chicago. It is not a schedule for the sick baby,
but it is a carefully tabulated outline for the normal, healthy,
average child ranging from one week to one year in age. In
offering this table we remind the mother, if the baby is six
months old and not doing well on the food it is getting and a
change is desired by both mother and physician, that it is far
better to begin with the second or third month's prescription
and quickly work up to the sixth month's. This change may
often be accomplished in two or three days.</p>

<p>In all large cities there are to be found milk laboratories
which make it their business to fill prescriptions for the modification
of milk under the direction of baby specialists. This
milk can be absolutely relied upon. In specialized diet kitchens
in many large hospitals, these feeding prescriptions also may
be filled.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span></p>

<h4>TOP-MILK FORMULA<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span></h4>

<p>Top milk is the upper layer of milk which has been removed
after standing a certain number of hours in a milk bottle or any
other tall vessel with straight sides. It contains most of the
cream and varying amounts of milk. It may be removed by a
small cream dipper which holds one ounce, or it may be taken
off with a siphon, but it should never be poured off. To obtain
seven per cent top milk which is the one most ordinarily used in
the preparation of top milk formulas, we take off varying
amounts&mdash;according to the quality of the milk&mdash;which Doctor
Holt describes as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>From a rather poor milk, by removing the upper eleven ounces
from a quart, or about one-third the bottle.</p>

<p>From a good average milk, by removing the upper sixteen ounces,
or one-half the bottle.</p>

<p>From a rich Jersey milk, by removing the upper twenty-two
ounces, or about two-thirds the bottle.</p></div>

<p>Cream is often spoken of as if it were the fat in milk. It
is really the part of the milk which contains most of the fat
and is obtained by skimming, after the milk has stood usually
for twenty-four hours; this is known as "gravity cream." It
is also obtained by an apparatus called a separator; this is
known as "centrifugal cream," most of the cream now sold
in cities being of this kind. The richness of any cream is indicated
by the amount of fat it contains.</p>

<p>The usual gravity cream sold has from sixteen to twenty
per cent fat. The cream removed from the upper part (one-fifth)
of a bottle of milk has about sixteen per cent fat. The
usual centrifugal cream has eighteen to twenty per cent fat.
The heavy centrifugal cream has thirty-five to forty per cent
fat.</p>

<p>The digestibility of cream depends much upon circumstances.
Many serious disturbances of digestion are caused by cream.</p>

<p>It is convenient in calculation to make up twenty ounces of
food at a time. The first step is to obtain the seven per cent
milk, then to take the number of ounces that are called for
in the formula desired.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span></p>

<p>One should not make the mistake of taking from the top of
the bottle only the number of ounces needed in the formula, as
this may be quite a different per cent of cream and give quite a
different result.</p>

<p>There will be required in addition, one ounce of milk sugar
and one ounce of lime water in each twenty ounces. The rest
of the food will be made up of boiled water.</p>

<p>These formulas written out would be as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It is necessary to make the food weak at first because the infant's
stomach is intended to digest breast milk, not cow's milk; but if we
begin with a very weak cow's milk the stomach can be gradually
trained to digest it. If we began with a strong milk the digestion
might be seriously upset.</p></div>

<p>Usually we begin with number one on the second day; number
two on the fourth day; number three at seven to ten days;
but after that make the increase more slowly. A large infant
with a strong digestion will bear a rather rapid increase and
may be able to take number five by the time it is three or four
weeks old. A child with a feeble digestion must go much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
slower and may not reach number five before it is three or
four months old.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>It is important with all children that the increase in the food be
made very gradually. It may be best with many infants to increase
the milk by only half an ounce in twenty ounces of food, instead of
one ounce at a time, as indicated in the tables. Thus, from three
ounces the increase would be to three and one-half ounces; from
four ounces to four and one-half ounces, etc. At least two or three
days should be allowed between each increase in the strength of
the food.</p></div>

<h4>PEPTONIZED MILK</h4>

<p>Another modification which at times may be ordered by your
physician is peptonized milk. Since it is infrequent for the
proteins of milk to be the cause of indigestion, peptonized milk
has only a limited use, chiefly in cases of acute illness. The milk
is peptonized in the following manner:</p>

<p>Place the peptonizing powder (it is procurable in tubes or
tablets from the drug store) in a small amount of milk, and
after being well dissolved, put into the bottle or pitcher with the
plain or modified milk, after which the whole is shaken up
together. The bottle is then put into a large pitcher containing
water heated to about 110&deg; F. or as warm as would bear the
hand comfortably, and left for ten or twenty minutes (if the
milk is to be partially peptonized). To completely peptonize the
milk, two hours are required. Either of these formulas is only
used on the advice of a physician.</p>

<h4>BUTTERMILK</h4>

<p>In many cases of chronic intestinal indigestion, buttermilk
is used in place of the milk. It is prepared as follows: After
the cream has been taken from the milk and it has been allowed
to come to a boil, it is cooled to just blood heat. A buttermilk
tablet, having first been dissolved in a teaspoonful of sterile
water, is now stirred into the quart of warmed, skimmed milk
and allowed to stand at room temperature for twenty-four hours
at which time it should look like a smooth custard. With a
sterile whip this is now beaten and is ready for the sugar and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
the boiled water which is added according to the written prescription
from the doctor.</p>

<h4>CONDENSED MILK</h4>

<p>Under no circumstances should condensed milk be used as
the sole food of the baby for more than one month. Children
often gain upon it, but as a rule they have little resistance, and
they are very prone to develop rickets and oftentimes scurvy;
and, as noted elsewhere, orange juice should always be administered
at least once during the twenty-four hours as long as
condensed milk is used.</p>

<p>Of all the brands of condensed milk, those only should be
selected which contain little or no cane sugar. Perhaps the
"Peerless Brand" of evaporated milk is the most reliable and
in the preparation of food from this evaporated milk the same
amount of sugar, etc., should be added as we do in the preparation
of "whole milk" or "top milk."</p>

<p>We do not in any way advise the use of condensed milk.
Fresh milk should always be used where it is obtainable, but
in traveling it sometimes has to be used. Holt says, "It should
be diluted twelve times for an infant under one month and six
to ten times for those who are older."</p>

<p>Malted milk is a preparation suitable in some cases where
fresh cow's milk is not obtainable. Even better than condensed
milk, this food will be found serviceable in traveling, or in
instances where only very bad cow's milk is within reach.</p>

<h4>SPECIAL FOODS</h4>

<p>Most patent foods are made up of starches and various kinds
of sugars, and some of them have dried milk or dried egg
albumin added. Many flours under fanciful names are sold on
the market today. For instance, one flour with a very fanciful
name is simply the old fashioned "flour ball" that our great,
great grandmothers made; and, by the way, perhaps there is
no flour for which we are more grateful in the preparation of
infant food than the flour ball which is prepared as follows:
A pound of flour is tied tightly in a cheesecloth and is put into
a kettle of boiling water which continues to boil for five or six<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
hours, at the end of which time the cheesecloth is removed and
the hard ball, possibly the size of an orange, is placed on a pie
pan and allowed slowly to dry out in a low temperatured oven.
At the end of two or three hours, the ball, having sufficiently
dried, has formed itself into a thick outer peel which is removed,
while the heart which is very hard and thoroughly dry, is now
grated on a clean grater, and this flour has perhaps helped more
specialists to serve more sick babies than any other form of
starch known. It is used just as any other flour is used&mdash;wet
up into a paste, made into a gruel, which is boiled for twenty
minutes before it is added to the milk.</p>

<p>Whey is sometimes used in the preparation of sick babies'
food and is prepared as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>To a pint of fresh lukewarm cow's milk are added two teaspoons
of essence of pepsin, liquid rennet or a junket tablet. It is
stirred for a moment, then allowed to stand until firmly coagulated,
which is then broken up and the whey strained off through a
muslin.</p></div>

<p>The heavy proteins remain in the curd, and the protein that
goes through with the whey is chiefly the lactalbumin.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIX</h2>
<h2>THE FEEDING PROBLEM</h2>
</div>

<p>A friend of ours who presides over a court of domestic
relations in a large city, recently told us that he believed
much trouble was caused in families&mdash;many divorces, occasioned,
and many desertions provoked&mdash;because improperly fed
babies were cross and irritable and so completely occupied the
time of the mother, who, herself, knew nothing about mothercraft
or the art of infant feeding. Consequently, the home was
neglected and unhappy, quarreling abounded and failure, utter
failure, resulted. The children were constantly cross, and so
much of the mother's time was consumed in caring for these
irritable, half-fed babies, that the home was disheveled, the
meals never ready, the husband's home-coming was a dreaded
occurrence, and he, endeavoring to seek rest and relaxation,
usually sought for it in the poolroom or the saloon, with the
usual climax which never fails to bring the time-honored results
of debauch&mdash;despair and desertion.</p>

<p>In the beginning of this book we paid our respects to the
present-day educational system which does not provide an
adequate compulsory course in which all women could be given
at least a working knowledge of home making and the care
and feeding of the babies; so that statement need not be
repeated in this chapter. But we wish to add, in passing, that
ignorance is the basis and the foundation of more unhappy
homes, broken promises, panicky divorces, and shattered hopes,
as well as of more deaths during the first year of infancy, than
any other cause. And in speaking of its relationship to babycraft,
we believe that ignorance concerning normal stools, how
many times a day the bowels should move; how much a baby's
stomach holds; how often he should be fed, etc.&mdash;I say it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
ignorance of these essential details that lies at the bottom of
many problems which come up during the first year, particularly
the "feeding problem."</p>

<h4>INFANT WELFARE</h4>

<p>In the city of Chicago at the time of this writing, the Infant
Welfare Association maintains over twenty separate stations
where meetings are held for mothers, where lectures are delivered
on the care and feeding of babies. Babies are brought
to these stations week in and week out; they are weighed and
measured and, if bottle-fed, nurses are sent to the homes to
teach the mother how properly to modify the milk in accordance
with the physician's orders. The health authorities of our
city also maintain several such stations where mothers and
babies may have this efficient help. A corps of nurses are
employed to carry out the instructions and to follow up the
mothers and the babies in their homes, and thus the death rate
has been greatly reduced, not only in our city but in all such
cities where baby stations have been instituted. In a certain
ward in Philadelphia the death rate was reduced forty-four
per cent in one year after the baby stations were established.</p>

<h4>CHOOSING A FORMULA</h4>

<p>There are three classes of infants who require weak-milk
mixtures to begin with: namely, the baby who has been previously
nursed and whose mother's milk has utterly failed; the
baby just weaned; and the infant whose power to digest is low.
If these children were six months old, and the formula best
suited to them is unknown, we must begin with a formula
suited to a two- or three-month-old child and quickly work up
to the six-month formula, which may often be accomplished
within two or three days.</p>

<h4>THE BOTTLE-FED BABY</h4>

<p>When a baby is getting on well with his food, he should
show the following characteristics: He should have a good
appetite; should have no vomiting or gas; he should cry but
little; and he should sleep quietly and restfully. His bowels<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
should move once or twice in twenty-four hours. His stool
should be a pasty homogeneous mass. He should possess a clear
skin and good color. He should show some gain each week&mdash;from
four to eight ounces&mdash;and he should also show mental
development.</p>

<p>As long as a baby appears happy and gains from four to
eight ounces a week and seems comfortable and well satisfied,
the feeding mixture should not be changed or increased.</p>

<h4>MAKE CHANGES GRADUALLY</h4>

<p>In our experience with the artificial feeding of infants, we
have come to look upon the practice of gradually changing the
food formula as the most important element in successful baby
feeding.</p>

<p>We recall one mother in the suburbs who came to us with
her baby who had been feeding on a certain proprietary food.
She declared that it "just couldn't take cow's milk." She
admitted "it was not doing well," and so she would like to
have help. The baby was old enough, had it been normal, to
have been taking whole milk for some time. We recall our
having the mother prepare the proprietary food just as she had
been used to preparing it, and each day we had her throw
away one-half ounce and put in one-half ounce of whole milk,
this mixture she fed the baby for two days.</p>

<p>The next time, we had her take out one ounce of the mixture
and put in one ounce of whole milk, which we fed the baby
for three successive days; and then one and one-half ounces
were substituted which was fed to the baby for four days; and
thus we carefully, slowly, and gradually withdrew the proprietary
food and substituted fresh, certified cow's milk. It took
us a month to complete the change, but we are glad to add that
it was done without in the least disturbing the child.</p>

<p>Now, had the change been made abruptly&mdash;in a day or two,
or three days&mdash;the baby would probably have been completely
upset, while both the mother and the doctor would have been
greatly discouraged. Many mothers and even some physicians
have jumped from one baby food to another baby food; they
have tried this and they have tried that, until the poor child,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
having been the victim of a number of such dietetic experiments,
finally succumbed.</p>

<p>We cannot urge too strongly the fact that, as a rule, whenever
a change is made from one food to another, it should be
done gradually, unless it be the change of a single element
such as that of a very high per cent of cream found in top
milk mixtures, when it seems to be a troublesome element in
the milk. No bad effects will follow the quick change to
skimmed milk with added sugar, starches, etc; but in changing
from a proprietary food to a milk mixture, the change should
always be made gradually, the quantity of the new food being
increased gradually. Milk should be increased by quarter (1/4)
ounce additions, and it should not be increased more than one
ounce in one week; while the mixture should not be increased
as long as the baby is gaining satisfactorily. A wise mother
and an experienced physician can usually see at a glance when
a child is doing well&mdash;by the color and consistency of the stools,
the child's appetite, his sleep, and his general disposition.</p>

<h4>COMMON MISTAKES IN FORMULAS</h4>

<p>First and foremost, we believe a great mistake is often made
in using too heavy cream mixtures; babies as a rule do not
stand the use of too high a percentage of cream. Formulas
that call for whole milk should contain four per cent fat or
cream; and while babies often gain rapidly on the higher percentage
of cream found in a rich Jersey milk, nevertheless,
sooner or later serious disturbances of digestion usually occur.
Herd milk is, therefore, better for the babies because in the
"whole milk" of the herd of Holsteins we have only about
four per cent fat.</p>

<p>Another common mistake is too heavy feeding at the time of
an attack of indigestion; even the usual feeding may be too
heavy during this time of indisposition. It is not at all uncommon
for us to dilute baby's food to one-third its strength at
the time of an acute illness.</p>

<p>Still another trouble maker is dirt&mdash;dirt on the dish-towel,
dirt on the nipple, dirt in the milk, dirt on the mother's hands.
Dirt is an ever present evil and an endless trouble maker, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
evidenced by stool disturbances, indigestion, fretful days, and
sleepless nights. A dirty refrigerator is another factor which
has been responsible for much illness and distress.</p>

<p>Indigestion is often brought on because a nurse, caretaker,
or possibly the mother, not wishing to go down to the refrigerator
in the middle of the night, brings up the food early in
the evening and allows it to become warm&mdash;to remain in a
thermos bottle&mdash;and we are sure that had they been able to
see the enormous multiplication of germs because of this warm
temperature, they would never have given occasion for such
an increase in bacteria just to save themselves a trifle of inconvenience.</p>

<p>Still another common mistake is to use one formula too long;
a feeding mixture which was good for four or possibly six
weeks, must be changed as the child grows older and his
requirements become greater. Let the weight, stools, general
disposition and sleep of the child be your guides, and with
these in mind errors in feeding can be quickly detected and
minor mistakes speedily rectified.</p>

<h4>SYMPTOMS OF DISSATISFACTION</h4>

<p>Some of the pointed questions which are put to a young
mother who brings her child into the office of the baby specialist,
are the following:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em;">
Does the baby seem satisfied after his feeding?<br />
Does he suck his fist?<br />
How much does he gain each week in weight?<br />
Does he sleep well?<br />
Does the baby vomit?<br />
What do his bowel movements look like?<br />
Will you please send a stool to the office?<br />
</p>

<p>With the intelligent answers to these questions&mdash;after knowing
the birth weight and the age of the child and its general
nervous disposition&mdash;the physician can formulate some conclusion
as to the babe's general condition and can usually
find a feeding formula that will make him grow.</p>

<p>Vomiting, restlessness, sleeplessness and the condition of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
bowels, are the telltales which indicate whether or not the food
is being assimilated; and the stools may vary all the way from
hard bullet-like lumps to a green diarrhea.</p>

<p>Babies do not thrive well in large institutions where the
food is so often made up in a wholesale manner, for the simple
reason that the food elements are not suited to the need of
each individual baby. Some infants are unable to digest raw
milk, and for them sterilized or boiled milk should be tried;
others require a fat-free mixture such as skimmed milk, while
still others may need buttermilk for a short time. Babies
require individual care, particularly in their food, and the good
or bad results are plainly shown in the stools, weight, sleep, etc.</p>

<h4>FLATULENCE</h4>

<p>Flatulence is an excessive formation of gas in the stomach
and bowels leading to distension of the abdomen and the belching
of gas, and often the bringing up of a sour, pungent, watery
fluid.</p>

<p>Flatulence is seen in infants suffering from intestinal indigestion
and the food is nearly always at fault. This condition
is the result of the faulty digestion of the sugar and starches&mdash;particularly
the starch&mdash;which should be immediately
reduced. In such conditions the addition of a slight amount
of some alkaline (such as soda, magnesia or lime water) to
the food often produces good results. Great patience must be
exercised with a child that suffers from flatulence, for immediate
improvement can hardly be expected; time is required for the
restoration of good digestion.</p>

<h4>VOMITING</h4>

<p>Vomiting is perhaps more often the result of over feeding or
too frequent feeding than anything else. A healthy, breast-fed
baby may now and then regurgitate a bit, but it simply spills
over because it is too full. We do not refer to this as vomiting,
we refer to the belching up or vomiting of very sour or acrid
milk which leaves a sour odor on the clothing. This can all
usually be rectified by lengthening the intervals from two to
three hours and preventing bolting of food by getting a nipple<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
whose hole is not so large. Too much cream in the food will
also sometimes cause vomiting.</p>

<p>Too frequent feeding at night is another cause of vomiting.
When the stomach is full, the failure to lay the baby down
quietly, as is so often seen in those homes where bouncing and
jolting are practiced, may also result in vomiting.</p>

<p>Vomiting may be the first sign of many acute illnesses such
as scarlet fever, measles, pneumonia, whooping cough, etc.</p>

<p>The treatment for acute vomiting is simple. All foods should
be withheld&mdash;nothing but plain, sweetened water should be
administered, while it is often advisable to give a dose of
castor oil. A physician should be called at once if the vomiting
continues, and not until the vomiting has entirely ceased
for a number of hours and water is easily retained, should food
be given, and even then it should be begun on very weak
mixtures.</p>

<h4>OVER-FEEDING</h4>

<p>The size of the child's stomach should be the guide to the
quantity of food given, and attention is called to the table
given in a previous chapter. All food taken in excess of his
needs lies in his stomach and intestines only to ferment and
cause wind and colic. The symptoms of over-feeding are restlessness,
sleeplessness, stationary weight (or loss in weight),
and oftentimes these very symptoms are interpreted by the
mother as sufficient evidence that the baby needs more food;
and so the reader can see the terrible havoc which is soon
wrought where such ignorance reigns.</p>

<h4>WEIGHT</h4>

<p>The weighing time should immediately follow a bowel movement
and just before a feeding time; then, and only then,
we have the real weight of baby, as a retained bowel movement
may often add from four to five ounces to the child's weight.
There should be a careful record of each weighing, for there
may develop a great difference if different members of the
family endeavor to keep the weight in their minds. The normal
baby should gain four to eight ounces a week up to six months,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
and from then on the weekly gain is from two to four ounces;
in other words, by six months the baby should double his birth
weight and at the end of a year his weight should be three
times the birth weight. A stationary or diminishing weight
demands careful attention; a good doctor should be called at
once. Likewise, a very rapid increase in weight is not to be
desired, as we do not want a fat baby, but we do desire a well-proportioned
and alert baby, and, as someone has said, it is
better to have little or no gain during the excessive heat than
to upset the digestion by over-feeding, designed to keep the
baby gaining.</p>

<p>In weighing, usually the outside garments are removed,
leaving on a shirt, band, diaper, and stockings with the necessary
pins; the little fellow thus protected is placed into the
weighing basket and at each successive weighing, these same
clothes or others just like them are always included in the
weight, and it should be so reported to the physician.</p>

<h4>THE STOOLS</h4>

<p>In the chapter "<a href="#CHAPTER_XII">Baby's Early Care</a>," the first stools were
described in detail, and there we learned that the dark, tarry,
meconium stools are quickly changed within a week to the
normal canary-yellow stool, having the odor of sour milk.</p>

<p>The bottle-fed babies' stools differ somewhat in appearance;
they are thicker and a lighter color, but should always be
homogeneous if the food is well digested. They do not have
nearly the number of bowel movements each day that the
breast-fed baby does. If a bottle-fed baby's bowels move once
a day and he seems perfectly well otherwise, we are satisfied.
And curds (white lumps), or mucus (sedimentary, slimy
phlegm), indicate that the food is not well digested.</p>

<h4>BOTTLE FEEDING AND CONSTIPATION</h4>

<p>A bottle baby may be constipated because the proteins are
too high, the fat too high, the food of an insufficient quantity
or quality, or the milk have been boiled, while weak babies
really may lack the muscular power to produce a bowel movement.
With the help of your physician endeavor to arrive<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
at the cause of the constipation, and, if the baby is two or
three months old, from one to two teaspoons of unsweetened
prune juice may be administered. Milk of magnesia may be
added to the food (leaving out the lime water), or a gluten
suppository may be used.</p>

<p>The change from milk sugar to malt sugar has helped many
infants; while the giving of orange juice (after six months) is
very beneficial in many cases. A small amount of sweet oil may
be injected into the rectum which will lubricate the hard lumps
and thus favor comfortable evacuation. The periodicity of the
bowel movement (at definite times each day) is a matter of
great importance. Immediately after a meal, if the child is
old enough, he should be placed on the toilet chair. A bit of
cotton, well anointed with vaseline and inserted into the rectum
just before meals, will often aid in producing a bowel movement
shortly after the meal has been taken.</p>

<p>Abdominal massage should be administered in all instances
of constipation, beginning with light movements and gradually
increasing, with well-oiled hands.</p>

<h4>DIARRHOEA</h4>

<p>Diarrhoea usually accompanies acute intestinal indigestion and
is so often associated with the common disorders of infancy
that we refer the reader to the chapter "Common Disorders
of Infancy." Dark stools should always be saved for the
physician to observe, as they frequently contain blood. Stools
full of air bubbles with pungent sour odor show fermentation;
in which cases the starches should be reduced, if not entirely
taken away from the food mixtures. Green stools mean putrefaction
from filth-germs; a thorough cleansing of the bowel
should be immediately followed by a reduction in the strength
of the food and the boiling of the milk.</p>

<h4>REGULATION OF THE STOOLS</h4>

<p>At a certain time each day the napkin should be removed
and the child should be held out over a small jar. It is surprising
to note how quickly and readily the little fellow cooperates.
Diaper experiences may be limited to much less than<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
a year if the mother has patience enough and the baby has the
normal intelligence to enter into this regulation regime. We
recall one caretaker who complained bitterly because the child
under her care constantly wet his diaper; so the caretaker
was instructed to keep a daily schedule of the baby's actions
for five days; and, to her surprise, she discovered that the
baby urinated about the same time each day. A regularity
was also noted concerning the bowel movements.</p>

<p>The variations in the time of the urinations were only
fifteen or twenty minutes, so nearly did the kidneys act at
the same time each day. The caretaker was instructed to remove
the diaper and hold the baby out at the earliest occurrence on
the daily schedule, and, to the astonishment of the entire
family, no further accidents occurred, and the child soon acquired
the habit of letting them understand when he was about
to wet his diaper. Bowel movements may be regulated more
easily than the urination. After the child is about a year old,
very few accidents should occur.</p>

<h4>MIXED FEEDING</h4>

<p>In many instances, and particularly if the infant is under
six months of age, and where he has had to have additional
feeding from the bottle&mdash;under such circumstances the breast
milk may be continued as "partial feeding," at least until the
baby has reached his ninth or tenth month, at which time it
may be wholly discontinued.</p>

<p>At each nursing time the baby empties both breasts, and
the amount he draws may readily be estimated by carefully
weighing him before and after each nursing. By referring
to the directions in a previous chapter, the quantity of food
needed for his size and age may be determined; while the deficit
is made up from a bottle of milk containing properly modified
cow's milk.</p>

<p>If the mother's health admits, or if the breasts continue to
secrete a partial meal for the babe, mixed feeding should be
continued until after the ninth or tenth month, when it can
gradually be reduced from four or five times each day to once
or twice a day, until it is finally omitted altogether. In the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
meantime, the baby is gradually getting stronger food and at
eleven or twelve months the little fellow is able to subsist and
thrive upon whole milk.</p>

<h4>INFANT FEEDING PUZZLES</h4>

<p>It is very difficult to explain how some babies thrive on some
certain food while others grow thin and speedily go into a decline
on the same r&eacute;gime. The hereditary tendencies and predispositions
undoubtedly have a great deal to do with such puzzling
cases.</p>

<p>Again, sometimes a slight variation in technic or some other
trifling error in connection with the preparation of the
baby's food, may be more or less responsible for the variation
in the results obtained. No two mothers will prepare food
exactly alike even when both are following the same printed
directions and these slight discrepancies are enough to upset
some delicately balanced baby.</p>

<p>On the other hand, some babies are born with such strong
digestive powers and such a powerful constitution that they are
easily able to survive almost any and all blunders as regards
artificial feeding, while at the same time they also manifest the
ability to surmount a score of other obstacles which the combined
ignorance and carelessness of their parents or caretakers
unknowingly place in the pathway of early life which these little
folks must tread.</p>

<p>The fact that so many babies do so well on such unscientific
feeding only serves to demonstrate the old law of "the survival
of the fittest"&mdash;they are born in the world with an enormous
endowment of "survival qualities"&mdash;and in many cases the
little fellows thrive and grow no matter how atrociously they
are fed.</p>

<p>There may be other factors in the explanation of why some
babies do so well on such poor care, but heredity is the chief
explanation, while adaptation is the other. If the little fellows
can survive for a few weeks or a few months, the human
machine possesses marvelous powers of adaptation, and we
find here the explanation why many a neglected baby pulls
through.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span></p>

<h4>INFANT FOODS</h4>

<p>Rickets and scurvy have so often followed the prolonged use
of the so-called "infant foods" which have flooded the market
for the past decade, that intelligent physicians unanimously
agree that they are injurious and quite unfit for continued use in
the feeding of infants. If they are prescribed to replace milk
during an acute illness, or at other times when the fats and
proteins should be withheld for a short period, both the
physician and the mother should be in the possession of definite
and exact knowledge as to just what they do and do not contain.
To provide such knowledge, we present the analysis
(Holt) of some of the more commonly used infant foods.</p>

<p>1. <i>The Milk Foods.</i> Nestle's Food is perhaps the most widely
known. The others closely resembling it in composition are
the Anglo-Swiss, the Franco-Swiss, the American-Swiss, and
Gerber's Food. These foods are essentially sweetened, condensed
milk evaporated to dryness, with the addition of some
form of flour which has been dextrinized; they all contain a
large proportion of unchanged starch.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Liebig or Malted Foods.</i> Mellin's Food may be taken
as a type of the class. Others which resemble it more or less
closely are Liebig's, Horlick's Food, Hawley's Food, malted
milk, and cereal milk. Mellin's food is composed principally
(eighty per cent) of soluble carbohydrates. They are derived
from malted wheat and barley flour, and are composed chiefly
of a mixture of dextrins, dextrose, and maltose.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Farinaceous Foods.</i> These are Imperial Granum,
Ridge's Food, Hubbell's Prepared Wheat, and Robinson's Patent
Barley. The first consists of wheat flour previously prepared
by baking, by which a small proportion of the starch&mdash;from
one to six per cent&mdash;has been converted into sugar.</p>

<p>In chemical composition these four foods are very similar to
each other, consisting mainly of unchanged starch which forms
from seventy-five to eighty per cent of their solid constituents.</p>

<p>4. <i>Miscellaneous Foods.</i> Under this head may be mentioned
Carnrick's Soluble Food and Eskay's Food.</p>

<p>The composition of the foods mentioned is given in the accompanying
table.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XX</h2>
<h2>BABY'S BATH AND TOILET</h2>
</div>

<p>From earliest girlhood, women have loved their dolls, and
one of the greatest joys connected with the adored experience
was the make-believe bath and the dressing of the make-believe
baby; so now, when we are the happy possessors of real
live dolls, we should go about the task with the same lightheartedness
of a score of years ago when we hugged, kissed,
bathed, and dressed our dolls. There is one big advantage now,
the doll won't break; but, we sigh as we stop to think, we can't
stick pins into it as we all did into the sawdust bodies of our
dolls those years and years ago.</p>

<h4>THE FIRST WEEK</h4>

<p>In the chapter on "<a href="#CHAPTER_XII">Baby's Early Care</a>," this subject was
fully discussed and we only wish to repeat, in passing, that
before baby's bath or toilet is undertaken the hands of the
mother, nurse, or caretaker must be scrupulously clean. And
while the first day's bath usually consists of sweet oil, albolene,
or benzoated lard, if the new baby happens to come during the
very warm days of July or August and the oil seems to irritate
the soft downy skin, as it often does during those hot days, a
simple sponge bath may be substituted. The cord dressing
remains as the doctor left it, and if there be any interference,
let it be subject to his orders.</p>

<p>The cord usually drops off, and the abdomen is entirely healed
by the seventh to the tenth day, after which time baby is daily
sponged for another week. And now we will describe in detail
the simplest, easiest manner of administering an oil bath or a
sponge bath.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span></p>

<h4>GIVING THE BATH</h4>

<p>A large pillow or a folded soft comfort is placed on a table
in a warm room&mdash;temperature not below 75 F. On baby's
tray near by, and within reaching distance, are the boracic acid
solution in a small cup, a medicine dropper, the warm saucer
of oil, the toothpick applicators (made by twisting cotton about
one end, making sure the sharp end of the pick is well protected),
a glass jar of small cotton balls made from sterile
absorbent cotton, the castile soap, talcum powder, needle and
thread. A vessel of warm water, several old, soft, warmed
towels and the clean garments required, complete the layout.</p>

<p>Into the warm, soft blanket on the pillow or comfort we
place the partially undressed baby, for the binder, diaper, and
socks are not removed until the head-and-face toilet is completed.</p>

<p>The top of the head, behind the ears, the folds of the neck,
and the armpits are now gently but thoroughly rubbed with
oil, which is then all rubbed off with a soft linen towel. The
eyes next receive two or three drops of the boracic acid solution,
put in by the aid of the medicine dropper, while, with a
separate piece of cotton, the surplus solution is wiped off each
eye, rubbing from the nose outward.</p>

<p>Then with the applicator made by wrapping cotton about the
end of a toothpick, oil is put into each nostril, all the time exercising
the utmost care not to harm the tender mucous membrane.
The ears are also carefully cleansed with a squeezed-out dip of
boracic acid on the applicator.</p>

<p>Unless there is an inflammation present in the mouth, and
the physician in attendance has ordered mouth swabbing, do not
touch it; for much harm is done the mucous membrane of the
baby's mouth by the forceful manner in which much of the
swabbing is done. The face and head are then washed with
warm water; very little soap is needed and, when used, must
be most thoroughly rinsed off.</p>

<h4>THE SECOND WEEK</h4>

<p>And now during the second week, we proceed to sponge the
baby's body; the hands are washed with soap and rinsed, and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
only those who have performed this feat know just how tightly
they hold shut their little fists. These hands must be relaxed, and
all the lint, dirt, and perspiration be thoroughly washed away.
The arms, shoulders, chest, and back are then sponged. All the
time the nurse or caretaker is standing while carrying out this
most pleasant task. At any time she may quickly cover the
babe and stop for this or that with no inconvenience to herself
or the child.</p>

<p>After the thorough drying of baby's upper body, a bit of
talcum is put under the arms, in the folds of neck, etc., and the
shirt is slipped on. Next the band, diaper, and stockings are
removed and after first oiling the groin and the folds of the
thighs and the buttocks, the same sponging, drying, and powdering
is done here as on the upper body.</p>

<p>The band is now applied, and <i>sewed on</i>. The diaper, stockings,
booties, and&mdash;if a winter baby&mdash;the skirt and outing
flannel gown (for babies should wear only night dresses for the
first two or three weeks) are now slipped over the feet and
drawn upward, and baby is ready for nursing or for his nap.</p>

<h4>TEMPERATURE OF BATHS</h4>

<p>First few weeks, 100 F.; early infancy, 98 F.; after six months,
97 F., cooling down to 90 F.</p>

<p>A wooden bath thermometer may be purchased for twenty-five
cents and it should be in every home where babies are
bathed. In the absence of a thermometer do not depend upon
the hand to determine temperature. Thrust the bared elbow
into the water and if it is just comfortable&mdash;neither hot or
cool&mdash;it is probably about the correct temperature for baby.
Do not shock the baby by dashes of cold water, for, while it
may amuse an onlooker, it unnecessarily frightens your child,
and, subconsciously, he learns to dread his bath.</p>

<h4>THE BATHING PLACE</h4>

<p>If the bathroom is warm&mdash;temperature 75 F.&mdash;that is the
most logical place for the bath, provided baby has his own tub.
Place a couple of strong slats several inches wide across the
big tub, six inches apart, and on this place the baby's tub. Of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
course, care must be exercised to prevent slipping by means of
properly fitted cleats on the under surface of the slats. The
mother should always stand to bathe her baby and the small
tub should be placed at such a height that she neither has to
stoop nor bend. Thus the bathing of the baby becomes a
pleasure instead of a "job" or an "irksome task."</p>

<p>If the bathroom is not warm then the kitchen table or a small
table pulled up near the stove is a place par excellence for the
dip.</p>

<p>Many boils seen on young baby's tender skin have been traced
to the careless use of the family tub to bathe the baby in. Not
until the child is two or three years of age, when his skin has
become more toughened, should he be allowed to use the
family tub.</p>

<h4>FREQUENCY OF BATHS</h4>

<p>To begin with, we never bathe either a baby or an adult
immediately after a full meal. From one hour to one and one
half hours should intervene.</p>

<p>The frequency of baths depends somewhat upon the season
of the year, the vitality of the child, and the warmth of the
home.</p>

<p>We have seen many infants who were bathed too often. The
vitality expended upon the necessary reaction following a tub
bath was too much for the little fellow; the daily bath was
stopped and a semi-weekly bath substituted, much to the gain
of the child. Of course in this instance the hands, face, and
buttocks received a daily sponging.</p>

<p>The oil bath may be administered daily. In robust children
the tub bath may be a daily affair; while in pale, anemic little
folks, the tub bath is perhaps better given twice a week. In
hot summer days a sponge bath may be given many times a
day.</p>

<h4>BEST HOUR FOR BATHING</h4>

<p>Again this depends upon several factors; the warmth of
the house or apartment, the vitality of the child, and the kind
of bath to be administered.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span></p>

<p>An oil bath may be given any time&mdash;often it may be administered
entirely under the bed clothes, only care must be taken
to keep oil from the blankets.</p>

<p>Many of our mothers prefer to give the tub bath at five
o'clock in the afternoon, when the house is thoroughly warm,
and the child is thereby prepared for the long night's sleep.
Before dressing in the morning an oil bath or rub may be
given in such cases.</p>

<p>If the forenoon is selected as the time for bathing the child,
then an hour just before the mid forenoon meal is the best.
In either event, be regular about it&mdash;do it at the same time
every day. Let the caretaker attend to her many duties, and,
as far as possible, mothers, bathe your baby yourself. The
folds of the skin, the creases in the neck, the clenched fists,
must all receive particular care, and no one in all the world will
ever care as you&mdash;the mother&mdash;cares.</p>

<h4>SOAP AND WATER</h4>

<p>Select a soap free from irritants and excess of alkalis. There
are few kinds that equal the old-fashioned, white castile soap
our grandmothers used.</p>

<p>Very hard water which makes the skin rough and sore may
be improved by boiling, but if possible substitute rain water for
it. A flannel bag tied over the faucet and changed each day
will help to clarify muddy water, provided the stream flows
gently through it.</p>

<h4>ROUTINE OF THE TUB BATH</h4>

<p>Just as we directed the nurse or caretaker to stand while the
oil rub or sponge bath was given, so we admonish the mother
to stand while the tub bath is given. First, get everything in
readiness for the bath as directed for the oil bath, and then
the baby's tub setting on the securely cleated slats placed across
the top of the family tub may be filled with water by means of
a hose attached to the faucet. The temperature should be
100 F. when baby is dipped in to be rinsed.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 13. Supporting the Baby for the Bath.</span>
</div>

<p>The head and face toilet are identical with that described
before, and with the baby undressed and wrapped in a warm
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>towel placed inside the warm blanket on the pillow or comfort
as before mentioned, we proceed with a good lather of castile
soap and water to lather the baby's body all over&mdash;under the
arms, the neck, chest, groins, thighs, buttocks, legs, feet, and
between the toes, while the genitals also receive their share of
attention. The foreskin of the boy baby is gently pushed back
and cleansed thoroughly; while the vulva of the little girl baby,
having first been swabbed with boracic acid, is now gently
lathered and cleansed. Now grasp the ankles and legs with the
right hand and support the upper back and neck and shoulders
with the left and gently lower the baby into the water in a semi-reclining
position (See <a href="#illus-015">Fig. 13</a>). The water should cover the
shoulders. Keep a good firm supporting left hand under the
head, neck, and shoulders, and with the right, rinse all soap from
the body.</p>

<p>After this is thoroughly done, lift the baby out onto a fresh
warm towel inside the warm blanket on the pillow, and remain
standing, while you gently pat (never rub) the baby dry. All
the little folds, creases, and places between fingers and toes,
are carefully patted <i>dry</i>, and where any two skin surfaces rub
together put on a bit of talcum.</p>

<p>The dressing takes place in the manner already described&mdash;first
the shirt, then the band (sewed on), the diaper, stockings,
skirt, and gown.</p>

<p>Please note that the soap bath is contra-indicated (should not
be given) in case of eczema.</p>

<h4>BABY'S DAILY RUB</h4>

<p>This soap bath should be administered for cleanliness only,
and should be given twice a week. If a tub bath is to be given
on other days, after the routine head and face toilet, the baby
is simply dipped into the water and the soft skin gently rubbed.</p>

<p>If the sponge or tub bath is given in the afternoon just
before the long sleep at night, then the oil rub should take
place before the mid-forenoon meal; and likewise, if the sponge
or tub bath is given during the mid forenoon, then the oil rub
or dry hand rub is given before the going-to-bed time. The
rub should be a daily procedure for the first two years. Nothing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
rougher than the soft palm of the hand should be rubbed on
baby's soft skin.</p>

<h4>USE AND ABUSE OF TALCUM</h4>

<p>Babies have come to my clinic with <i>cakes</i> of talcum under
their arms, and particularly between their thighs and in the
crease of the buttocks. Here the well-meaning but thoughtless
mother had reasoned, "a little is good; more is better" which
is not always the case.</p>

<p>Talcum is not used to replace careful drying, and it should
never be found in quantities on the baby's skin any more than
you would expect to find quantities of face powder caked in the
creases of the neck or behind the ears of an adult. The skin
is first cleaned, then patted entirely dry, and, as a finishing touch,
a bit of talcum is put on by means of a puff.</p>

<h4>TONIC AND MEDICATED BATHS</h4>

<p>Tonic baths are usually given to older children when they
are able to enter into the sport and frolic of a cool bath. Baths
are called tonic because they call forth from the body a reaction&mdash;a
sort of circulatory rebound. This rebound or reaction
brings the blood to the skin, increases the circulation, and tones
up the nerves. The room should be properly warmed and, if
necessary, some form of exercise be continued after the bath
to prevent the chill that sometimes follows a poorly administered
bath.</p>

<p>In the case of the anemic child, after six months of age,
the mother's hand dipped in cold water may briskly rub the chest
and back until it glows or becomes red. The child should enjoy
this bath. Never frighten a child by throwing cold water on
it or by giving it a too sudden cold plunge; great harm may be
permanently done by these efforts to "toughen the baby."</p>

<p>The simple medicated baths may be administered according
to the following directions:</p>

<p><i>Salt.</i> Use half a teacup of common salt or sea salt to each
gallon of water. The salt should first be dissolved in a cup
of warm water to prevent the sharp particles from pricking
the skin. The doctor sometimes orders a salt bath.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span></p>

<p><i>Starch.</i> Add a cup of ordinary, cooked laundry starch for
every gallon of water in the bath.</p>

<p><i>Soda.</i> A soda bath requires two tablespoons of ordinary baking
soda to a gallon of water, dissolving it in a little water
before adding it to the bath.</p>

<p><i>Bran.</i> Make a cotton bag of cheesecloth or other thin material,
six inches square. Fill loosely with bran. Soak the bag
in the bath water, squeezing it frequently until the water becomes
milky.</p>

<p>Starch, soda, and bran baths are often used in place of the
ordinary soap and water bath when the skin is inflamed, as in
cases of chafing or prickly heat.</p>

<h4>FEAR OF BATHS</h4>

<p>Force and harshness are not likely to cause baby to overcome
very much of the fear of a tub bath. Patience, perseverance,
and purposeful diversion of mind will bring sure results.</p>

<p>In the case of a very young baby, have a helper stretch a
towel across the filled baby tub, lay the baby in it, with its
head well supported, and then gently lower the towel into the
water, keeping the head out. (Most anyone would fear an
all-over ducking, if he had ever been completely ducked into
water by a careless or mischievous friend).</p>

<p>In the case of older children, celluloid ducks, fish, or boats
may float about on the water, and the entire bath be forgotten
by the little fellow's enjoyment of "his boats."</p>

<h4>OUT OF DOOR BATHING</h4>

<p>Although a baby under two years should never be given a sea
bath, a word of caution about sea bathing for young children may
not be amiss. The cruelty with which well-meaning parents treat
young, tender children by forcibly dragging them into the surf, a
practice which may be seen at any seaside resort in the summer,
can have no justification. The fright and shock that a sensitive
child is thus subjected to is more than sufficient to undo any
conceivable good resulting from the plunge. On the other hand, a
child who is allowed to play on the warm sand and becomes
accustomed to the water slowly and naturally will soon learn to
take delight in the buffeting of the smaller waves, but he should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
not be permitted to remain more than a minute or two in the water,
and should be thoroughly dried, dressed immediately, and not left
to run about the beach in wet clothing.</p>

<h4>MILK CRUST</h4>

<p>Any roughness on the scalp must receive immediate attention.
This roughness, or milk crust, is entirely avoidable; it
is the result of accumulated oil and dirt. When it has formed
a complete crust or cake, it may quickly become eczematous
and require a physician's advice; however, in the beginning,
at the first sight of brown patches or roughness, oil the scalp
thoroughly at night with vaseline or cold cream, which should
be gently rubbed off in the morning.</p>

<p>This vaseline or cold cream should be applied repeatedly,
several nights in succession, followed by the morning's gentle
rubbing and daily washing of the head. Often the washing
with water must be entirely avoided; only sweet oil or
vaseline being used in those cases where the crusting seems to
be persistent.</p>

<h4>THE EYES, EARS, AND NOSE</h4>

<p>At birth the eyes are particularly cared for. First, the mucus
is gently swabbed off the closed lids from the nose side outward,
and then follows the application of one drop of twenty
per cent argyrol or two per cent silver nitrate, either of which
thoroughly disinfects the eye and prevents the growth or
development of any bacteria that may have gotten into the
child's eye during the descent of the head through the birth
canal. The neglect of this procedure may sometimes result
in lifelong blindness.</p>

<p>Under no circumstances should "a mere cold in the eyes"
be neglected; it may result in blindness. Call your physician
at once, and if he is not at hand, wash out the eye thoroughly
every hour with warmed ten per cent boracic acid solution, by
means of a medicine dropper, using a separate piece of cotton
for each eye, for if the slightest bit of discharge be carried
from one eye to the other an inflammation will quickly appear.</p>

<p>From birth, especially during the first week, baby's eyes are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
very sensitive to light; hence they must be carefully protected.
Babies should be so placed during their outings, sleep, or naps,
that they do not directly gaze at either the sunlight or sky.
The lining of the hood of the carriage should be green, instead
of white, as much eye strain is thus prevented.</p>

<p>The daily care of the normal, well eye has been already described,
and while it need not be reiterated, we may say, in
passing, that if the eyelid be at all inclined to be sticky or
adherent, never use force, but instead, gently swab with boracic
acid. As a preventive of this condition, a little vaseline from
the tube may be rubbed on the edges of the lids at night.</p>

<p>In the toilet of the ears, never attempt to introduce anything
beyond the external ear, which may be carefully cleansed with a
soft cloth. It is often found necessary to apply oil to the creases
behind the ears before the daily bath. There should be no
irritation, redness, or roughness present, all such conditions
being readily prevented by the use of oil or vaseline before the
bath.</p>

<p>With the sharp point removed, make a cotton applicator out
of a toothpick, and gently (with no force, whatever) introduce
vaseline or oil into the nose. This should be a part of
baby's daily toilet. Any stoppage of mucus or snuffiness in the
nose should be reported at once to baby's physician. Young
babies often have adenoids.</p>

<h4>CARE OF THE MOUTH</h4>

<p>Leave the well mouth alone until the teeth appear, and then
keep the teeth very clean (allowing no particles of milk to
accumulate at their bases) with a soft bit of cotton and gentle
rubbing. When a child attains the age of two, he should have
his own toothbrush; previous to this time all food particles
should be removed from between the teeth with waxed silk
floss. All decay should be promptly attended to by a competent
dentist.</p>

<p>Thrush and ulcers are often caused, not prevented, by the
frequent wiping out of baby's tender mouth. The treatment
of thrush and other mouth infections will be considered in a
later chapter, "The Common Disorders of Infancy."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span></p>

<h4>THE CARE OF THE GENITAL ORGANS</h4>

<p>Before the bath, the baby girl's genitals are carefully swabbed
between all the folds with boracic acid solution. The foreskin
of the boy baby should be pushed well back and washed
gently with water. If the foreskin of the male child be
long, tight, or adherent, circumcision is advised. See our chapter,
"Teaching Truth."</p>

<p>The genitals of both the boy and girl should be kept scrupulously
clean every day, with as little handling as possible, and,
upon the appearance of the least swelling, discharge, or even
redness, the physician's attention should be at once called to it.
In a later chapter, the subject of irregularities of sex habits
will be taken up.</p>

<h4>CARE OF THE BUTTOCKS</h4>

<p>Often, because of irritating bowel movements, the buttocks
become reddened, chafed, and sometimes raw in places. Some
poor little babies are sometimes roughly rubbed&mdash;scoured on
the buttocks&mdash;much like the kitchen sink, many times a day,
and it is not surprising that they become reddened, chafed, and
very much inflamed.</p>

<p>The buttocks require a gentle swabbing and thoroughgoing
"patting dry" after each soiling or wetting of the diaper, but
no soap is required in this region but once a day, and even
then it should be used sparingly.</p>

<p>When the buttocks are inflamed, after a good cleansing with
water and a thorough drying, vaseline or zinc ointment should
be applied on a piece of sterile cotton, and this application should
be repeated after each changing of the diaper. Wet diapers
should be removed at once, for the acidity of the urine causes
more chafing. A dusting powder composed of starch two parts,
and boracic acid one part, may be dusted on after a cleansing
with oil.</p>

<p>Great care should be exercised in the thorough daily rinsing
of the diapers as well as in the tri-weekly boil in the laundry.
White soap only should be used in their cleansings; no washing
sodas or other powders should be used.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span></p>

<h4>OTHER SPECIAL CARE</h4>

<p>Under the arms and in the creases of the neck the skin sometimes
becomes irritated because of neglect. To prevent such
chafing the following program should be carefully carried out:</p>

<ol>
<li>Not too much soap&mdash;and no strong soap.</li>
<li>Careful rinsing of the skin area.</li>
<li>Avoid harsh rubbing, but thoroughly dry.</li>
<li>The use of talcum powder in all folds of the skin.</li>
</ol>

<p>With a fine camel's hair brush the hair should receive its
brushing after the cleansing of the scalp. Combs are for just
one purpose and that is to part the hair. The brush should be
used to do all the smoothing.</p>

<p>While the frequent trimming of the hair has no marked effect
upon its growth, yet the comfort the little girls enjoy, especially
during the warm-weather months, should not be denied them.</p>

<p>And certainly the boy should become a boy when he puts on
trousers and not be made the laughing stock of his mirthful
companions just because his "beautiful long curls are much
admired by the mother and his aunts."</p>

<p>The finger nails should be trimmed round with the scissors,
while all hangnails are properly cared for every day. Toe nails
should be cut straight across and the corners never rounded off.
Many ingrowing nails may be thus avoided.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXI</h2>
<h2>BABY'S CLOTHING</h2>
</div>

<p>The Eden story suggests that in the beginning of our racial
experience artificial clothing was unnecessary; but after a
time, in that selfsame garden, proper clothing became an important
problem and has remained so ever since. Everybody
seems to agree, however, that baby's clothing in particular should
at least be comfortable. It may give the child great discomfort
because it may be too warm, or it may not be warm enough, or it
may be too tight, and so, in the discussion of baby's clothing in
this chapter, we are going to keep in mind these two things&mdash;comfort
and heat.</p>

<h4>GENERAL SUGGESTIONS</h4>

<p>The choice of material demands some thought and attention.
As a rule, baby's clothing materials should be light in weight,
good moisture absorbers, and at the same time able to retain the
body heat. Most layettes have the common fault of being prematurely
outgrown; and so it is well to allow for ample growth
in making baby's first clothes. Since the principal object of
clothing is to insure a uniform body temperature, it is important
that the mother be constantly on her guard to keep the baby
cool enough in the summer and warm enough in the winter.</p>

<p>The mothers of various races and nations have their own ideas
concerning the clothing of their babies. One mother will wrap
her baby in cotton, which is held in place by means of a roller
bandage, and as you visit this home during the first week of
baby's life, you will be handed a little mummy-shaped creature&mdash;straight
as a little poker&mdash;all wrapped up in cotton and a
roller bandage. The surprising feature is that the baby does not
seem to complain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span></p>

<p>In another district of the city we find the baby dressed in
starched clothes, ribbon sashes, bright ribbon bows on its arms
and around its neck. At first glance you wonder if the little
child is not many years older and is about to make a visit to a
county fair, but on inquiry we find that he has only been prepared
for the event of circumcision on the eighth day.</p>

<p>And if you go into the forest of primeval days you will find
another mother bandaging her baby to a board, head and all, and
he seems to live and thrive in his little woven nest strapped on
the back of his Indian mother.</p>

<p>Other babies in the warmer portions of the earth have almost
less than nothing on, and are left to be swung by the breezes
in little baskets tied to the boughs of trees; being taken up only
when it is time to feed.</p>

<h4>BABY'S LAYETTE</h4>

<p>In preparing an outfit for the newcomer it is wise to provide
for the necessities only, because of the fact that since the baby
grows very fast the layette will soon have to be discarded; it
is always possible to get more clothing after the baby is here
and started on his little career. We offer the following list of
essentials for the new born baby:</p>

</table>

<h4>BANDS AND SHIRTS<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span></h4>

<p>The binder should be made of an unhemmed strip of flannel
six inches wide and twenty inches long, so that it goes around
the abdomen once with a small overlap. This binder should be
sewed on instead of being pinned, and serves the purpose of
holding the dressings of the cord in place. It is usually worn
from four to six weeks, when it is replaced by a silk and wool
barrel-shaped band with shoulder straps and tabs at the bottom,
both front and back, to which may be pinned the diaper. This
band is worn through the first three or four years to protect
the abdomen from drafts and chilling, thus guarding against
those intestinal disturbances which are caused by sudden weather
changes.</p>

<p>There is great danger of having the bellyband too tight, and,
in the early weeks, it is often the cause of great discomfort&mdash;often
interfering with the normal expansion of the stomach at
meal time.</p>

<p>No matter what the season, the new-born baby should be
clothed in a light-weight silk and wool shirt, preferably the second
size. After the first month, if the weather is exceedingly
warm, this woolen shirt may be displaced by a thin silk or lisle
shirt. In buying the second-size shirts always secure the
stretchers at the same time, for in the laundering they soon
shrink so that they are very uncomfortable for the young babe.</p>

<h4>DIAPERS</h4>

<p>There are a number of materials on the market from which
comfortable diapers may be made for the baby. The cotton
stockinet (ready-made shaped diaper) is excellent, fitting
smoothly at the waist, while it is large and baggy at the seat,
thus permitting not only a comfortable feeling but the free use
of the hips, without the bulkiness of the ordinary diaper.</p>

<p>The large square of cheesecloth is easily laundered, and if an
inside pad is used makes a very acceptable diaper.</p>

<p>The stork diapers are made of materials resembling turkish
toweling and are used to some extent. This diaper should not
be confused with the stork rubber diaper which will be spoken
of later.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span></p>

<p>Birdseye cotton is popular and extensively used. It absorbs
quickly, and is much lighter in weight than linen. The first- and
third-size widths should be purchased as a part of the layette,
and the number of diapers needed depends upon the opportunities
to wash them out, for diapers are never used but once without
washing; they should always be quickly rinsed and dried
in the sunshine if possible. So if there are good laundry
privileges, and daily washing is possible, the mother can get
along with fewer diapers, but no less than four dozen should
be provided.</p>

<p>The diaper pad will be found convenient and serviceable in
the early days when the skin of the child is so very tender. This
pad should be pieces of clean old linen or small pads of absorbent
cotton.</p>

<h4>CHANGING THE DIAPER</h4>

<p>During the mother's waking hours, the diaper should be
changed as soon as it is soiled or wet. If the child cries
during the night it should be changed immediately, but
the mother should not feel called upon to lay awake nights
merely to change the baby's napkin when it is soiled. If she
places a pad underneath the baby, which will absorb the urine
quickly, he often does not awaken or become chilled. The pad
should be sufficiently thick to ensure that the nightgown does
not get wet.</p>

<h4>RUBBER DIAPERS</h4>

<p>Rubber sheeting diapers of any description should never be
used. Avoid all patent diapers with a covering or an inner lining
of rubber, for, like the rubber diaper, they not only irritate
the child but also retain moisture and heat, which produce
such irritation and itching that the subsequent "habit-scratching"
often lays the foundation for future bad practices. It is
far better for the mother to carry about with her, whenever it
is necessary to take the baby away from home, a rubber pad
which she puts on her lap underneath the little fellow, thus
affording ample protection to herself without in the least harming
the baby.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span></p>

<h4>STOCKINGS AND BOOTIES</h4>

<p>During the winter months merino stockings are required,
while during the summer months a thin wool or silk stocking is
sufficient; on the extremely hot days thin cotton hose may be
worn. During infancy, the stockings should be fastened to the
diaper with safety pins, while on the second-year child, hose
supporters attached to the waist are found very convenient.</p>

<p>A friend told me the other day of a mother who told her
the following story: "Do you know, I don't have any trouble
any more about my baby keeping up his socks for I have fixed
it so they won't come off any more. Every time I looked at his
feet he had kicked off his socks and they were no good to him
at all, so I took little chunks of brown laundry soap, moistened
them and rubbed his legs, as well as the inside of his socks and
I never, never have any more trouble with them coming off."</p>

<p>It does not seem possible in this enlightened age that a mother
could be so ignorant as to keep the socks up with brown soap,
but the friend assured me it was a true story, and while it may
shock some of my readers as it did me, I must add, in passing
to another subject, that the use of round garters on little babies
and young children is just about as shocking.</p>

<p>During the fall, winter, and spring, booties are worn on top
of the stockings. These booties should be crocheted or knitted
out of the heavy Germantown yarn, and there should be enough
of them so that the child may have a clean pair on every day.</p>

<h4>SKIRTS AND PETTICOATS</h4>

<p>The flannel petticoat is made with yokes instead of bands,
and during the fall, winter, and spring these yokes are made of
flannel like the skirt and should have long sleeves of the same
material. The yokes should be made large enough so that they
may be used during the entire first year (the plait in the front
can easily be taken out when the baby is six months old so that
it may be used much longer than if the yoke is made without a
plait). For the hot summer months, the yokes should be a
thin cotton material without sleeves; and, if the baby is housed
in an over-heated apartment, this fact should be borne in mind
and the winter skirt should be made accordingly. We have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
found, however, that the baby who is amply protected and uniformly
dressed, does not require the outer bundlings that the
poorly dressed child requires. Part wool and cotton materials
are very comfortable in the overheated city apartments. White
skirts are not necessary for small babies. They only add extra
weight and it is always foolish to put anything on a small baby
simply for looks.</p>

<h4>NIGHTGOWNS, WRAPPERS, AND SLIPS</h4>

<p>The nightgowns should be made of soft cotton flannel or
stockinet. The latter is really the better, and can be purchased
in sizes up to two years; it is absorbent, easily laundered,
and may be conveniently drawn up at the bottom by means
of a drawstring.</p>

<p>At least seven nightgowns are needed. A fresh nightgown
should be used each day and each night during the first four
or five weeks of baby's life; while as he gets older (two or three
years), the night drawers with feet in them are used to advantage.</p>

<p>The wrappers are usually made of challis, nun's veiling, cashmere,
or other light woolen materials which can be readily
washed. They are very serviceable to wear over the baby's
thin slips and on cool nights they may be used over the nightdress.
They should be simply made, containing no heavy seams,
and at the neck there should be the simplest kind of a soft band
that will in no way produce friction or in any other way irritate
the baby's skin.</p>

<p>Slips are usually made of some very soft material such as
nainsook, batiste, pearline, or sheer lawn cloth. Twenty-seven
inches is the length that will be found both comfortable and
convenient. All laces, ruffles, and heavy bands which will
scratch or irritate should be avoided as eczema is often caused
by such mistakes.</p>

<h4>SLEEPING BAG</h4>

<p>The sleeping bag is of inestimable value, affording extra and
secure covering for the child, and peace of mind for the
mother. In the early weeks it should be made of light flan<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>nel,
but as the child gets older the sleeping blanket is made
according to illustration (See <a href="#illus-009">Fig. <ins class="typo" title="Transcriber's note: original reads '5'">7</ins></a>) by merely folding a
blanket in such a manner that the child cannot possibly uncover
himself. The mother can sleep undisturbed, knowing that the
baby is always safely protected by at least one warm blanket
cover.</p>

<h4>COMMON FAULTS WITH MOST LAYETTES</h4>

<p>As a usual thing the first clothes are made too small. The
sleeves are too short as well as too small around. There is
nothing more uncomfortable than a tight sleeve. Everyone of
our readers knows that, and we recall one poor little fellow who
kept up a fretful cry until we took the scissors and cut the
tightly stretched sleeve up to and including the arm hole. He
then relaxed and went to sleep. Sleeves should be made two
inches longer than they are needed at first, and it is a very simple
matter to pin them up or turn them back at the wrist. They
should be loose and roomy.</p>

<p>The yokes of the dresses usually are too tight before the slips
are discarded. Heavy seams and raw seams irritate and often
make ugly impressions on the baby's skin.</p>

<p>Usually the first layette is profusely embroidered, and, while
it is beautiful to look at, the mother feels when she sees it outgrown
so quickly that a lot of vital energy was wasted on garments
that mattered so little as long as baby was comfortable.
Baby is dear and sweet enough without the fuss and furbelows
of such elaborate garments.</p>

<p>Heavy materials are sometimes used where lighter ones would
serve better.</p>

<h4>ERRORS IN CLOTHING</h4>

<p>A soiled garment should never be put back on the baby. Dirt
draws flies, and flies are breeders of disease. Sour-smelling
garments should be changed at once. They are likely to make
the baby sick and interfere with his appetite if left on indefinitely.
The care of the diaper has already been mentioned.</p>

<p>The main symptom of too much clothing is sweating, and
when the baby sweats something must come off. If he has<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
perspired so much that his clothes are moist, the clothing should
be changed and the skin well dried with talcum powder. The
feet and hands should be kept warm, but the little head should
always be kept cool. When the baby is crying and getting his
daily exercise, remove some of the covering, loosen his diaper,
and let him kick and wave his arms in perfect freedom.</p>

<p>When the baby's feet and hands are cool he is not warm
enough. Cotton underskirts cannot be used in the dead of winter
on little babies. They do not hold the body heat as woolen
garments do. The baby's feet should always be warm and this
is particularly necessary in poorly nourished children. The
outer wrapper of woolen material should be added to such
baby's clothing. It is a safe rule to follow that if baby's hands
are warm and he is not sweating, he is "just about right."</p>

<h4>SHORT CLOTHES</h4>

<p>At the age from four to six months, baby's clothes are shortened.
This should not take place at the beginning of winter
if it can be avoided. If the first layette has consisted of only
the necessary garments, they are nearly worn out by the time
the short clothes are due; of those that do remain, the sleeves
should be lengthened, the arm holes enlarged, and all the little
waists let out. Creeping garments and bibs are now added to
baby's outfit, as well as leggings and other necessities for outdoor
wear. Remember that all garments must be loose&mdash;then
baby is happy.</p>

<p>About the same number of garments are found necessary
for the short clothes as were required at first; except that a
large number of creeping rompers should be added. These
creeping rompers should not be made of dark materials that do
not show the soil. We desire the dirt to be seen that we may
keep the baby clean, and if the creeping romper is made of a
firm, white material it may be boiled in the laundry, thus affording
ample and thorough cleansing.</p>

<p>We attributed a sick spell of one baby to the dark-blue calico
creeping romper which he wore day in and day out because it
"did not show" the soil. White ones are much to be preferred,
not only for looks but chiefly for sanitary reasons.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span></p>

<h4>CAPS AND WRAPS</h4>

<p>The cap should be made of a material that will protect from
drafts and cold air, but not of such heavy materials as will cause
too much sweating. There are a number of outside wraps that
can be purchased ready-made and which are comfortable, convenient,
and warm. They should be long enough not only to
cover the baby's feet well, but to pin up over the feet, thus
giving good protection from winds and drafts.</p>

<p>During the summer months nainsook caps or other thin materials
are to be preferred to the heavy crocheted caps that are
sometimes worn by babies. No starch should be used in the
caps or strings, and there should be no ruffles to scratch the
delicate skin of the baby. In all these outer garments, as well
as the under garments, the irritation of the skin must be constantly
borne in mind, as eczema is often produced in this
manner.</p>

<h4>THE FIRST SHOES</h4>

<p>The first shoe that is usually worn during the creeping days
is a soft kid shoe without hard soles. It is important that this
soft shoe be worn to protect the child's foot from chilling
drafts while creeping about.</p>

<p>As the baby nears one year of age the hard-sole shoe is
secured which must be wide, plenty long and comfortable in
every respect, and without heels. Rubbers and overshoes may
be worn on damp and cold days. Moccasins and slippers do not
give sufficient support to the ankles, so, when the baby begins to
walk, the shoes should be high and of sufficient support to the
tender ankles.</p>

<h4>PLAY SUITS</h4>

<p>As the baby grows up into the child, the tiny clothes are laid
aside and the boy is given substantial garments that in no way
remind him of girls' clothing. A child's feelings should be respected
in this manner, and while it often adds joy to the
mother's heart to see her boy "a baby still," remember that he
is not only chagrined but is nervously upset by these "sissy
clothes."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span></p>

<p>A child three or four years of age should still wear the
woolen binder supported from the shoulders, over which is the
union suit, stockings, and the buttoned waist from which hang
the hose supporters. The most comfortable and easily laundered
garment we know of for the small lad is the "romper,"
which should be made of washable materials that may be readily
boiled. For cool days a Buster Brown coat of the same material,
with patent-leather belt, may be slipped on over this washable
romper&mdash;which completes the boyish outfit.</p>

<p>We recall the pleasant days with our own little fellow when
he was between the ages of two and one-half and five years.
We were often compelled to be away from home&mdash;on the train,
in the hotel&mdash;and when traveling we used a black, smooth silk
material which was made up into rompers with low neck and
short sleeves. There were three such rompers, and two Buster
Brown coats with wide, black, patent-leather belts which completed
the traveling outfit. During the warm days on the train
the coat was folded carefully and laid aside. In the early
morning and in the cool of the evening the coat was put on,
and he always looked neat and clean. At night, before undressing
him, the entire front of the romper was cleansed with
a soapy washcloth, rinsed, and rubbed dry with a towel, and,
after carefully spreading to avoid wrinkles, it was hung over
the foot of the bed. The coats were sponged or pressed once
or twice a week, and this simple outfit served its purpose so well
that it was repeated three different summers.</p>

<p>The little girl as she leaves her babyhood days should be put
into garments that do not necessitate the constant admonition,
"Keep your dress down, dear." We like to see knickerbockers,
the exact color of the dress, made for every outfit, in which the
little girl may kick, lie down, jump, dance, climb&mdash;do anything
she pleases&mdash;unmindful of the fact that her "dress is
not down." The same undergarments are used for the little
girl as were mentioned for the little boy.</p>

<h4>WINTER GARMENTS</h4>

<p>Always bear in mind the over-heating of the child with heavy
garments indoors, and the danger of skin chilling and drafts on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
going out to play in this over-heated condition. Let the children
dress comfortably cool in the house, and as they go out
to play add rubber boots or leggings and rubbers, sweaters, caps
with ear laps or the stockinet cap. Allow them the utmost
freedom in clothes, and always encourage romping in the cool
frosty air.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII</h2>
<h2>FRESH AIR, OUTINGS, AND SLEEP</h2>
</div>

<p>Fresh air is just as important and necessary for the baby
as for the adult. Neither baby, youth, nor adult can receive
the full benefit of his food&mdash;in fact it can not be burned
up without the oxygen&mdash;without an abundance of fresh air.
During the early weeks of life, the air baby breathes must be
warm; nevertheless, it must be warmed <i>fresh</i> air, for baby
requires fresh air just as much as he needs pure food.</p>

<h4>INDOOR AIRING</h4>

<p>The delicate child often requires more fresh air than does
the normal baby. Both appetite and sleep are improved by fresh
air. The digestion is better, the cheeks become pink, and all
the signs of health are seen in the child who is privileged to
breathe fresh air.</p>

<p>During the early days, say after the third week, baby should
be well wrapped up with blanket and hood, tucked snugly in
his basinet or carriage, while the windows are opened wide and
the little fellow is permitted to enjoy a good airing. Even in the
winter months the windows may be raised in this way for a few
minutes each day. These "airings" may be for ten minutes
at first, and, as the child grows older, they may be gradually
increased to four or five hours daily. The carriage or basket
should stand near the window, but not in a direct draft.</p>

<h4>OUTDOOR LIFE</h4>

<p>In summer, a baby one week old may be taken out of doors
for a few minutes each day; in the spring and fall, when baby
is one month old, it may go out for an airing; while, during
the winter months, the airing had better be taken indoors until<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
he is about two months old, and even at that age he should go
out only on pleasant days and should always be well protected
from the wind.</p>

<p>A young baby may enjoy the fresh air in his carriage or crib
on the porch, on the roof under suitable awnings, in the yard,
under the trees, and even on the fire escape. In fact, at proper
age and in season, he may spend most of his time out of doors
in the fresh air, if he has proper protection from the sun, wind,
and insects.</p>

<h4>BEST HOURS FOR AIRING</h4>

<p>During the balmy days of summer and early autumn, baby
may spend most of the time outdoors between seven in the morning
and sunset. During the cooler days of winter and the cool
and windy days of spring, the best hours for the airing are to be
found between eleven in the morning and three in the afternoon.</p>

<p>At six weeks, perhaps an hour a day in the fresh air is sufficient;
while at six months, four to six hours a day are a necessity,
and from then on&mdash;the more the better.</p>

<p>Now we realize that the mother of the farm household does
not always have as much time to take the baby out for his
airings as many of our city mothers; but we suggest to this busy
mother that the baby be rolled out on the porch or in the yard,
within her sight and hearing, and allowed to enjoy the fresh
air while the mother continues her work.</p>

<p>It is virtually a crime to try to keep baby in the kitchen, hour
after hour, while the busy mother is engaged at her tasks. A
hammock, a crib on casters, or a carriage, is just the coziest
place in the world for baby&mdash;out on the porch.</p>

<h4>THE COUNTRY BABY</h4>

<p>The average city baby really gets more fresh air than ninety
per cent of the country babies. Our city apartments are usually
steam heated, and our windows are open in the winter nearly as
much as in the summer. The country home is often only partially
heated by two or three stoves. The windows are closed
in summer to keep out the dust, heat, and flies, in the winter to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
shut out the cold, and so the baby who lives in such a home has
little chance to get fresh air.</p>

<p>The city mother is constantly talked to about the benefits of
fresh air. The daily paper brings its health column to her,
her pastor talks of it on Sunday, and&mdash;best of all&mdash;the older
children come home from school and reiterate the doctrine of
fresh air that is constantly being preached to them at school.</p>

<p>Screen the windows, rural mother, and oil the roads in front
of your residence, and then keep your windows open. Remember
that baby's health is of more value than the meadow lot
or even a fortune later on in life. Plan for a new heating plant,
if necessary, so that the home can be both warmed and ventilated
during the winter.</p>

<h4>WHEN NOT TO TAKE BABY OUT</h4>

<p>If a sheltered corner of the porch is within the reach of the
mother, we can hardly think of a time when the baby cannot
be taken out. It may rain, the wind may blow, it may snow or
even hail, but baby lies in his snug little bed with a hot water
bottle or a warmed soapstone at his feet. As long as the finger
tips are warm, we may know he is warm all over, and a long
nap is thus enjoyed in the cool fresh air. When the sheltered
corner of the porch is lacking, we wish to caution the mother
concerning the following weather conditions:</p>

<p>1. When the weather is excessively hot, take him out only
in the early morning and late in the afternoon.</p>

<p>2. In extremely cold, below zero, weather, let his airing be
indoors.</p>

<p>3. Sharp and cold winds may do much mischief to baby's
ears, as well as blow much mischief-making dust into his nose
and eyes. In the case of dust or sand storms, baby remains in
the house.</p>

<p>4. All little people enjoy the rain, and only when the raincoat,
rubbers, and umbrella are missing should they be robbed
of the "rainy-day fun". In the case of baby's outing on rainy
days, ample roof protection is the only factor to be considered;
if it is adequate, then take him out; if it is lacking, let the airing
be done indoors.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span></p>

<h4>WINTER OUTINGS</h4>

<p>The very young baby is taken out for a fifteen-minute airing
during the noon hour when he is two months old; before this
time he receives his airing indoors. The interval is gradually
lengthened until most of the time between eleven and three is
spent out of doors. The reddened cheeks, the increased appetite,
all tell the story of the invigorating benefits of cool, fresh
air. Most babies dislike heavy veils, and they may be avoided
by a fold of the blanket arranged as a protection shield from
the wind.</p>

<p>The wind shield, procurable wherever baby carriages are
sold, should be a part of the outdoor equipment, as it greatly
helps in the protection of the baby.</p>

<p>The wind should never blow in his face; neither should he
lie, unprotected, asleep or awake to gaze up into the sunshine
or the sky&mdash;or even at a white lining of the hood of his carriage.
The lining should be a shade of green, preferably dark
green. And while it may be necessary during the summer to
suspend a netting over the carriage to protect from flies, mosquitoes,
etc., it should never lie on his face.</p>

<h4>OPEN WINDOWS</h4>

<p>Many of our readers recall with sadness of heart a little
hunchback child or a life-long invalid confined to a bed or wheel
chair because some careless but well-meaning caretaker or
mother left an open window unguarded; and&mdash;in an unlooked
for moment&mdash;baby crawled too near, leaned out too far, and
fell to the ground. The little fellow was picked up crippled
for life; and so while it is very essential to baby's health to
have open windows, admitting fresh air, they should be amply
guarded. Screens afford protection if well fastened, and in
their absence a slat three inches wide and one inch thick may
be securely fastened across the opening, thus preventing all such
tragedies with their life-long regrets.</p>

<h4>SLEEP</h4>

<p>If any of our readers have seen a new-born baby immediately
after he has been washed, dressed, and comfortably<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
warmed, they have observed that he usually goes to sleep at
once, and that he generally sleeps from four to six hours.
Babies, especially new-born babies, need just four things:
warmth, food, water, and sleep.</p>

<p>And while the babies sleep they are not to be disturbed by
the fond mother's caresses and cuddling&mdash;feeling of the tiny
hands, smoothing out the soft cheek, or stroking his silky hair&mdash;for
all such mothers are truly sowing for future trouble. Let
baby absolutely alone while sleeping, and let this rule be maintained
even if some important guest must be disappointed. If
such cannot wait till baby wakens, then he must be content with
the mental picture drawn from the mother's vivid description of
baby&mdash;his first smile, his first tooth, his first recognition of the
light, etc. The wise mother cat never disturbs her sleeping
kittens.</p>

<h4>SLEEP REQUIREMENTS</h4>

<p>Sleeping, eating, and growing occupy the whole time of young
babies. Until they are two months old they need from eighteen
to twenty hours sleep out of each twenty-four; and not less
than sixteen hours up to the end of the first year.</p>

<p>At six months, baby should sleep right through the night
from six in the evening until six in the morning, with a ten
o'clock feed, which should be given quietly, in a darkened
room, the babe being immediately returned to his bed.</p>

<p>At two or three years of age, twelve to fourteen hours of
sleep is required; while at four to five years, eleven to twelve
hours are needed; when they attain the age of thirteen years
they should still have ten hours of unbroken sleep each night.</p>

<p>As a general rule, children should sleep alone; even in the
case of two brothers or two sisters, separate beds are far better
than a double bed for both hygienic and moral reasons.</p>

<p>Baby should have a separate bed. The temptation to nurse
him on the least provocation, as well as the danger of overlying,
are reasons enough for such an arrangement.</p>

<h4>PUTTING BABY TO SLEEP</h4>

<p>At five-thirty in the afternoon, baby should be undressed,
rubbed or bathed, made perfectly comfortable, and fed; then,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
my mother reader, he should be laid down in his little bed and
allowed to go to sleep, without any coaxing, singing, rocking,
or even holding his hand. Babies will do this very thing and
continue to do it if you never begin to rock, jolt, bounce, or sing
to them; and, mind you, if you do sing to them or rock them,
or even sit near without doing anything but "just hold their
tiny hands," there will come a time when you greatly desire to
do something else&mdash;you have many urgent duties awaiting
you&mdash;and baby not being old enough to understand the circumstances,
begins to wail out his feeling of neglect and abuse.
It is nothing short of wicked thus to spoil a child.</p>

<p>We have seen so many beautiful babies go to sleep by themselves
without any patting, dangling, or rocking, that we encourage
and urge every mother to begin right, for if the little
one never knows anything about rocking and pattings he will
never miss them; and even if the baby is spoiled through extra
attention which sickness often makes necessary, then at the first
observance of the tendency on the part of the child to insist on
the rocking, or the presence of a light in the sleeping-room, or
the craving for a pacifier, we most strongly urge the mothers
to stick to the heroic work of "letting him cry it out."</p>

<p>The notion that the household must move about on tiptoes
is not only unnecessary but perfectly ridiculous. From the very
hour of his birth, let the child become accustomed to the ordinary
noises of the home, and if this plan is early started he
will prove a blessing and a ray of sunshine to the family and
not an autocrat to whom all must bow and bend the knee.</p>

<h4>BEDTIME AND SLEEPING POSITION</h4>

<p>Bedtime is regulated somewhat by the hour of rising in the
morning. Usually, up to two years, baby is put to bed from five
to six <span class="smcap">p. m.</span> Regularity is urged in maintaining the bedtime
hour.</p>

<p>The seven o'clock bedtime hour is later established and continued
until the young child attains school age, when retiring
at the curfew hour of eight o'clock gives our boy or girl from
ten to eleven hours of sleep, which is essential to proper growth,
calm nerves, and an unruffled temper.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span></p>

<p>The first few days finds our little fellow sleeping nine-tenths
of his time. Let him lie on his right side, for this favors the
complete closure of the fetal heart valve, the foramen ovale.</p>

<p>Whether baby lies on his stomach, his side, or with the hands
over his head is of little or no consequence. His position should
be changed first from one side to the other until he is old enough
to turn himself.</p>

<h4>WAKING UP AT NIGHT</h4>

<p>Before baby is three months old, he should receive nourishment
during the night at nine and twelve, and again at six in
the morning. After four or five months a healthy child should
not be fed between the hours of ten <span class="smcap">p. m.</span> and six <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>
At this age, many children sleep right through from six <span class="smcap">p. m.</span> to
six <span class="smcap">a. m.</span> without food.</p>

<p>After five months, if a healthy baby awakens between ten
<span class="smcap">p. m.</span> and six <span class="smcap">a. m.</span> warm water may be given from a
bottle; he soon forgets about this and the night's sleep becomes
unbroken. There are many other reasons than the need of food that cause
the wakefulness of the child; and since the baby should, after
a few months, sleep undisturbed and peacefully, if he is wakeful
and restless&mdash;crying out in a peevish whine&mdash;and then
quiets down for a few moments only to cry out again, you may
suspect one of a half-dozen different things. Let us, therefore,
summarize the things which may disturb baby's sleep:</p>

<p>1. <i>Lack of Fresh Air.</i> Babies cannot sleep peacefully in a
hot, stuffy room, or in a room filled with the fumes of an oil
lamp turned low. A crying fretful baby often quiets down as
if by magic, providing he is not hungry and the diaper is dry,
when taken into a cool room with fresh air. After the first two
months the temperature of the sleeping room should be fairly
cool and fresh.</p>

<p>2. <i>Clothes and Bedding.</i> The night clothes may be irritating
and causing perspiration, while the bedding may be wrapped too
snugly about the child. If baby's neck is warm and moist, you
may know that he is too warm. If the diaper is wet it should
be changed at once. One of the worst habits a baby can possibly
get into is to become so accustomed to a wet diaper that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
it does not annoy him. In cold weather he is changed under
the bed clothing without exposure or chilling. It may be the
bedding is cold and, if so, it should be warmed up by the
use of the photophore previously described, or by means of the
flannel-covered hot water bottle.</p>

<p>3. <i>The Food.</i> Too little, too much, or the wrong kind of food,
will disturb baby's sleep. Indigestion is very easily produced in
babies who are improperly fed. For instance, the mother's milk
may be lacking in nourishment and baby may really be hungry;
or, as in the case of a bottle-fed baby, it is usually due to over
feeding. Many mothers we have known who sleep with their
babies or who sleep very near them, nurse them every time they
wake up or murmur, and this soon becomes one of the biggest
causes of disturbed sleep.</p>

<p>4. <i>Spoiling.</i> A lighted nursery or bedroom, rocking to sleep,
jolting the carriage over a door sill or up and down, the habit of
picking baby up the moment he cries, late rompings&mdash;any and
all of these may disturb sleep, as well as unsettle the tender
nervous system of the child, thus laying the foundation for
future nervousness, neurasthenia, and possibly hysteria. This
is particularly true in the case of the children who have nervous
parents.</p>

<p>5. <i>Reflex Causes.</i> Wakefulness is sometimes due to reflex
nervous causes such as the need for circumcision, or the presence
of adenoids, enlarged tonsils or worms. Does baby have to
breathe through his mouth? Then you may suspect adenoids
or other conditions which should be removed.</p>

<p>6. <i>Chronic Disorders.</i> The presence of scurvy or syphilis
causes the child to cry out sharply as if in acute pain, while
in older children tuberculosis of the spine or hip is attended by
a sharp, painful crying out during sleep. Malnutrition or
anemia are also conditions which greatly disturb sleep.</p>

<p>7. <i>Soothing Syrups.</i> Untold trouble, both physical and nervous,
is bound to follow the giving of soothing syrups. These
medicines soothe by knocking the nerves senseless and never by
removing the cause. They contain morphin, opium, cocain,
heroin, and other drugs which deaden pain, and are most dangerous
to give baby.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span></p>

<h4>DAILY NAPS</h4>

<p>The morning nap from the sixth month on should be from
two to three hours long, out on the porch, well protected; while
the afternoon nap may be from one to one and a half hours
long with an interval of two or three hours before bedtime.
The child should be wakened at regular intervals for
feedings during the day&mdash;every three hours until he is six
months old, and then every four hours. These naps should
be taken in a cool place&mdash;on the porch, on the roof, in the yard,
under a tree, or on the protected fire escape.</p>

<p>If the nap is to be taken indoors, then lower the windows from
the top and darken the room. All children should take daily
naps until they are five or six years old.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII</h2>
<h2>BABY HYGIENE</h2>
</div>

<p>Possibly if all our babies could grow up in a mild, warm
climate, out of doors, where they were cared for by mothers
who had nothing else to do but enjoy nature in a garden, their
babies unhampered by clothes and other conventionalities inflicted
upon us by our present standards of living&mdash;well, if that
were our environment, probably this chapter on baby hygiene
would not need to be written. But realizing that variable
climatic conditions, the indoor life, and the necessary bundling
up with clothes, all tend to increase the ever-present danger of
infection from thickly settled peoples and their domestic pets&mdash;these
facts, together with the further fact that modern social
conditions make it necessary for some mothers to toil long hours&mdash;all
these influences, I say, considered separately or combined,
make it imperative for us to give thoroughgoing consideration
to the essentials of baby hygiene. The subjects of
fresh air, sleep, bathing, etc., have been duly discussed in previous
chapters.</p>

<h4>WATER DRINKING</h4>

<p>As soon as the newborn baby has been washed and dressed,
before he is put to sleep, he is given two teaspoons of warm,
boiled water in a sterile bottle with a clean nipple. This is repeated
every two hours when he is awake, until he is old enough
to ask for water himself. This water should contain no sugar, or
anything else&mdash;just clean, boiled water. It is better to give
this water from a bottle; for in case of enforced weaning, this
practice of taking his water from a bottle, will have made
him acquainted with that method of feeding.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span></p>

<h4>URINATION</h4>

<p>The baby may pass very little urine during the first day or
two of his life, but if the warm, boiled water is administered
regularly, the urine will soon become more abundant.</p>

<p>As the child nears two years of age, if put to bed at six <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>
he should be taken up at ten or eleven to urinate.</p>

<p>In older children, bed wetting is often corrected by serving
the last meal not later than four <span class="smcap">p. m.</span> and not allowing any
liquids after that hour.</p>

<p>The physician should be consulted in all instances where the
habit of bed wetting extends beyond three years. The subject
will be treated more fully in a later chapter.</p>

<h4>EXERCISE</h4>

<p>A baby pen, lifted up from the floor, well protected at the
sides, and covered with mosquito bar&mdash;if exposed to flies or
mosquitoes&mdash;affords splendid opportunity for exercise. Here
the little fellow may lay on a well-padded mattress and kick,
move his arms, and otherwise roll about to his own satisfaction.
It should not be in the direct sunshine, but rather in a protected,
somewhat shady place, yet where the air is pure and fresh.</p>

<p>Much exercise is obtained from the daily cry. Here, the arms,
legs, hands and feet, as well as the body, are all exercised until
the baby is pink. A good rebound of blood is flowing through
the well-warmed skin, while the baby is greatly benefited by
such daily exercise.</p>

<p>Later on, "creeping" is urged, but not forced. With regard
to standing&mdash;he will pull himself up on his feet just as soon as
nature qualifies him, and so he needs no urging or coaxing
in this matter. Older children should be encouraged in active
romping, games, etc., rather than to spend the entire day in the
more sedentary amusements, puzzle pictures, etc.</p>

<p>It is a most abnormal situation when a three-, or four-year-old
child is content to sit quietly all day. There is usually something
seriously wrong with a child who never soils his rompers,
who never makes a noise, and who does not seem to enjoy
normal play and fun.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span></p>

<p>Let the little folks early learn that the home is theirs to enjoy
and that their little friends are welcome; and thus you may be
spared such a reproof as one little lad of four unknowingly
gave his mamma. His little friend was approaching the stairs
of the play room, when the thoughtless mother carelessly and
impatiently remarked: "Oh, are you going to bring Ned upstairs?
you'll make so much noise." The little host met his
friend at the top with the words: "They don't want boys in
the house, we'd better go outdoors." The mother "woke up"
and arranged a little "party" upstairs for the two husky,
healthy&mdash;and noisy&mdash;boys.</p>

<p>During the creeping days remember that the floor is the
coolest part of the room, and in the absence of the creeping
pen, which is "built up" two feet above the floor, extra clothing
should be put upon the child while on the floor. During the
damp days of early spring and the cool days of late fall, as well
as on the bleak days of winter, baby is better off if he is kept
off the floor. It is a fine plan to put a number of table boards
on top of the springs of the baby's bed; in this way a sort of
pen is produced which is high above the cold floor and the baby
is content to spend much of his time in this little pen, happy
with his playthings.</p>

<h4>KISSING THE BABY</h4>

<p>We most strongly protest against the haphazard, promiscuous
kissing of babies. Many forms of disease, such as tuberculosis,
syphilis, diphtheria, influenza, common colds, etc., may be carried
to the child in this way.</p>

<p>The baby, notwithstanding his attractiveness, his beauty, and
his grace, should not be overfondled. Kissing the hand is not
much better than the mouth, for the hand quickly finds its way
to the mouth. If it be necessary to kiss a baby, then let the
kissing be done on the back of the neck or on top of his head,
but never on the face or hand.</p>

<h4>SUCKLING HABITS</h4>

<p>There came into the office one day a woman forty or more
years of age, whose mouth was markedly disfigured, and on my<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
inquiring as to the probable cause she said: "Doctor, it is the
result of sucking my thumb when I was a mere child, too young
to know better, and every time I look into the glass, which I
assure you is only when I am compelled to, I curse my parents
for not breaking me of that habit." The indulgent parents were
hated and despised for neglecting their duty, because of the
disfigurement which resulted from this unrestrained habit of
early childhood.</p>

<p>Thumb sucking, finger sucking, or pacifier sucking, are all
filthy habits, and should be early discouraged. To aid in overcoming
the habit of sucking the thumb or biting the fingernails,
the ends of the fingers and edges of the nails may be
painted with a solution of aloes or quinine. In extreme cases,
a splint may be placed on the anterior bend of the elbow, thus
preventing the possibility of raising the hand to the mouth.</p>

<p>The "sugar teat" of our mother's generation has passed, as
has also the "mumbling" of food for the young child; we no
longer give the babies concentrated sugar, nor do we "chew"
our children's food at the table.</p>

<p>Extreme cases of chalk or dirt eating have been noted; such
tendencies are decidedly abnormal, and require medical attention.</p>

<h4>KEEP BABY WARM</h4>

<p>Much colic and fretfulness may be avoided if baby is kept
warm. The finger tips are a good thermometer, for if they are
warm the feet usually are. "Bundling" is unnecessary, but
careful attention should be paid to keeping the feet and hands
warm without making the child sweat; that is an art, and all
mothers should attain it. An extra flannel wrapper and a pair
of heavy wool booties in the winter are good warmth producers.
Cotton flannel petticoats should be replaced by warm woolen
ones, and when the baby begins to get about on his hands and
knees a pair of loosely fitting wool tights, made from discarded
woolen underwear are of inestimable comfort and value. In
the effort to avoid draughts and body chilling, ever bear in mind
baby's need of fresh air and the dangers of sweating, for the
sudden cooling of a sweating child is a forerunner of pneumonia,
cold catching, diarrhoea, and other troubles.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span></p>

<h4>BABY'S TEMPERATURE</h4>

<p>During early infancy, baby's temperature sometimes varies
greatly; for instance, a rectal temperature may register 97.5 or
100.5 F. while the child may be in perfectly good health.</p>

<p>The baby's temperature should be taken at the rectum&mdash;which
should normally register 99.5 F. This temperature, as stated
above, may register 100.5 F., with no other symptoms of illness.
In taking rectal temperature the thermometer should remain
in place two minutes.</p>

<p>The groin is the next best place to take the temperature; here
the thermometer should remain five minutes, and the registry
is usually a degree lower than that of the rectum.</p>

<p>The baby's temperature usually is a good guide to the severity
of any illness. In case the temperature runs above 101 F. the
physician should always be notified and his orders carefully followed.
Slight causes often produce a high temperature of
103 to 105 F. for a short time; but such a temperature of
long duration means serious trouble and demands expert
advice and attention. Abnormal temperature will be more fully
considered in that section of this work entitled "Common Disorders
of Infancy."</p>

<h4>BABY BOUNCING</h4>

<p>The common custom of bouncing or trotting baby on the knee
is a harmful one. The young and growing nervous system of
the child is decidedly injured by this constant jolting and jiggling,
to say nothing of the "spoiling" effects of this practice.
There is a vast difference between the sensitive nervous system
of the infant, with its liability to shock and disturbances, and
that of the settled and developed nervous system of an adult.
The strength of the mother or nurse is so great that the jarring
not only often causes indigestion and vomiting in the infant,
but sometimes also lays the foundation for "wrecked nerves"
in later life.</p>

<p>The tossing of baby in the air comes in for the same condemnation.
Baby is not "our plaything," and must not be
bounced and tossed about like a rubber ball.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span></p>

<h4>CARRIAGES AND GO-CARTS</h4>

<p>The first carriage should be roomy and comfortable. The bed
should be thirty-three inches long and fourteen inches wide, and
should be twenty-eight or thirty inches from the floor. The
wheels should be rubber tired. The cover should be a good sized
hood containing a dark lining, and provided with a wind shield.
This dark lining creates a neutral shade for the eyes and protects
them from the glare of the sun and the bright skies.</p>

<p>The bed of the carriage should be soft and warm; and, with
the size before mentioned, there is ample room for the "tucking
in" with warm blankets, which are first spread out on the
bed and then the baby placed into the blanket, after which it
is brought up and over him.</p>

<p>The folding go-cart and the small carrying-basket are to be
used only in an emergency. They are convenient in traveling
or shopping for the mother who has no maid or caretaker with
whom to leave the baby; but they are not satisfactory pleasure
vehicles, neither should the baby be left to sit fastened in one
of these carts for any great length of time.</p>

<p>The mattress of the carriage should be of hair, while needed
warmth may be secured by the use of a thick, light-weight
woolen blanket, placed under the child and brought up and
around him.</p>

<p>A top covering for the carriage must have washing or dry
cleaning qualities. A crocheted afghan, a washable embroidered
cover, or a firm silk puff, are good covers. The one thing to be
remembered is that everything about the carriage soils readily,
and if this thought enters into the selection of fabrics, you will
not be disappointed when cleaning time comes.</p>

<p>The carriage pillow should be of down, except in the very hot
months, when hair is preferable. Simple, easily laundered slips
may be made from two men's-size handkerchiefs.</p>

<h4>BOW LEGS</h4>

<p>Particularly in boys and men, bow legs are not only awkward
but are a noticeable deformity; even the little folks notice them
and often remark about it, as did one child who sat profoundly
eyeing a very important visitor who stood before the cheerfully<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
lighted grate warming himself. The little fellow suddenly exclaimed,
"Oh, Mister, look out! You're warping." Such a
painful experience might have been saved this distinguished
gentleman had his mother or caretaker not urged his standing
too soon; and at the same time had fed him on the proper food,
so as to avoid "rickets." The ossification or hardening of the
bones of the legs continues all through childhood and is often
interfered with by improper feeding during the first two years
of life. Urging the little people to stand too early is to be discouraged.
Nature prepares them for it when the right time
comes; which time varies&mdash;thin children standing and walking
usually much earlier than heavy children.</p>

<h4>LIFTING THE BABY</h4>

<p>A very young baby should be lifted from his bed by grasping
the clothing below the feet with the right hand, while the left
hand slips underneath the back and with spreading fingers supports
the neck and head. It is then raised upon the left arm.
During the early months the entire spine must be supported in
this manner (See <a href="#illus-008">Fig. 6</a>). In grasping a baby under the arms
or about the waist, undue pressure is made upon the abdomen
and chest. Serious injury often follows the careless lifting of
the older child by his wrists or hands. The throwing or whirling
of the older children by the arms is strongly condemned. Dislocations
have followed such careless so-called fun.</p>

<h4>PREVENTION OF FALLS</h4>

<p>In the selection of the high chair, care should be given to the
possibility of overturning. Fortunately, baby's bones are only
partially ossified, else he would sustain many fractures in the
frequent falls and bumps. When we pause to consider the
thoughtless manner in which many babies are left on beds and
in unguarded chairs, it is not strange that they fall so often.</p>

<p>Open windows must be carefully protected by well-fastened
screens or by slats of wood. Beds afford a good place for a
romp or play, but high-backed chairs should be placed at the
side to prevent a fall. A strap across the waist should be fastened
to the sides of the carriage to prevent falling out. Every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>thing
possible should be done to prevent falls. Outdoor hammocks
are exceedingly dangerous for the baby. Never leave a
child in one unguarded. A little caution, a large amount of
common sense&mdash;the "good use of brains"&mdash;will prevent
scars and other lifelong deformities.</p>

<h4>THE BABY'S BREASTS</h4>

<p>Never allow anyone to manipulate or "break down" a swollen
breast in a girl or boy baby during the first week or two. This
swelling occurs often and should not be interfered with. A hot
compress of boracic acid solution may be applied, after which
a piece of sterile gauze should be placed over the swollen part
and held on by a muslin bandage. Secure medical attention if
the swelling does not go down in a day or two.</p>

<h4>VISITING</h4>

<p>Unless absolutely necessary, babies should not be taken on
trains and street cars; nor should they take long journeys into
the country to attend "reunions." Infections accompany crowds,
and baby is far better off at home, in the quiet of his natural
surroundings, than he is in the dust, closeness, and bustle of
illy ventilated cars, streets, shops, movies, or even at church.
Many an infant has been sacrificed by a train journey to "show
him off" to the fond grandparents; scores of babies acquire
whooping cough at the movies; and many a baby has nearly
lost his life by catching measles, scarlet fever, or diphtheria at
church; while the only thing accomplished by the church experiment
was the spoiling of the entire service by its fretful,
tired cry&mdash;the infant's only means of protest.</p>

<h4>THE RUNABOUT BABY</h4>

<p>"Runabouts" are the little folks between the age of one and
three years, and they require good care, good feeding, and warm
and comfortable dressing.</p>

<p>In general, they need the same fresh air, daily outings, and
daily naps of the younger child. Their hands need washing
oftener, and their clothing, which is usually a play romper,
should be either of white or fast colors that it may be most thor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>oughly
boiled, thus getting a good disinfection. Their eyes, nose,
and ears, as well as the genital organs, all require the most rigid
daily cleanliness.</p>

<p>The "bugbear" second summer need not be feared by the
mother who takes particular care to see that:</p>

<ol>
<li>The drinking water is boiled or distilled.</li>
<li>The orange is not overripe.</li>
<li>The banana is not underripe or overripe and is not eaten in chunks.</li>
<li>The milk is fresh and pasteurized.</li>
<li>The baby does not eat candy, ice cream, or other forbidden foods.</li>
<li>The baby's bowels move daily.</li>
<li>He does not remain dirty.</li>
<li>He naps daily.</li>
<li>He is protected from dust, flies, flees, and mosquitoes.</li>
<li>He does not go visiting, to church, shops, or "movies."</li>
</ol>

<p>The second summer is no harder than the first, as good clean
water, easily digested foods, and good general hygiene are all
a baby needs at this time. A large army of little folks grow up
in spite of the little care they get and the place in which they
live. Did they not possess good vital resistance, sound nerves,
and good digestion, the children of the "slums" and of the
"ghetto" would quickly succumb to their unhygienic surroundings.</p>

<h4>TOYS</h4>

<p>In selecting toys for the infant, it must be borne in mind that
they will be put to the mouth, and hence they should not be:</p>

<ol>
<li>Toys with sharp points.</li>
<li>Small enough to swallow, or to push into the nose.</li>
<li>Covered with hair or wool.</li>
<li>Glass that is easily broken.</li>
<li>Painted toys.</li>
<li>Toys that may be taken apart and the small parts swallowed.</li>
<li>Paper books that may be chewed or torn.</li>
</ol>

<p>Bear in mind that babies are easily amused with such simple
toys as:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span></p>

<ol>
<li>A half-dozen clothes pins.</li>
<li>An aluminum pan and a spoon.</li>
<li>Rubber toys (easily washed).</li>
<li>Celluloid dolls, ducks, and other floating toys.</li>
<li>Blocks.</li>
<li>A large rubber ball.</li>
</ol>

<p>The older children have wonderfully good times out of doors
with a spade, a cart, and the sandpile. Boys most thoroughly
enjoy a track with its engine and cars, switches, etc. They build
sham fortifications, truly works of art, with their blocks, while
the girls are happiest with dolls and household sets. However,
occasionally we meet a mother who has a girl who is really a
boy in her tastes for toys, and so we say to that mother: give
the little girl the desire of her heart; if it's a train instead of a
doll, or a toy gun instead of a doll's trunk, well and good, let
her have them. What we want are free and easy, natural, children.
They are much more likely to have good nerves, clean
thoughts, sound digestion, and equalized circulation.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIV</h2>
<h2>GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT</h2>
</div>

<p>The newborn baby comes into the world in an absolutely
helpless condition and completely unconscious of his surroundings.
He unconsciously performs certain acts, such as
opening his eyes, crying, urination, movement of the bowels,
and even nursing of the breast; but there is probably no distinct
voluntary action connected with any of these acts. All
of his senses at birth are practically dormant, but as the days
and weeks go by, they begin to awaken.</p>

<h4>SPECIAL SENSES</h4>

<p>The baby cries, but the tears do not actually flow over the
lids until he is three or four months old, and while the baby
may fix his eyes upon objects and distinguish light from darkness,
he will not wink nor blink when the finger is brought close
to the eye. Vision is probably not complete until the beginning
of the third month.</p>

<p>Infants are said to be deaf for the first twenty-four to forty-eight
hours after birth, and some authorities hold that they are
deaf for several days.</p>

<p>Taste is early developed, as a newborn baby will often repeatedly
show a desire to taste sweet things, while if sour or
bitter things are put to the tongue, it shows its displeasure.</p>

<h4>HAIR AND SCALP</h4>

<p>The newborn baby usually comes into the world with a good
head of hair, but the end of the first or second week witnesses
the falling out of much of this hair, and falling may continue
for even another week or two. The hair is often worn off on
the back of the head because of constant friction upon the
pillow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span></p>

<p>Children differ greatly in the growth of hair. Some of them
come into the world with heavy hair, and others lose it quickly
and remain nearly bald-headed until after the first year.</p>

<p>As the second hair grows in, it is usually lighter than it was
at birth and lighter than it will be later in life, as the hair has
a tendency to grow darker as the years go by.</p>

<p>The scalp should receive the care already mentioned. As the
hair comes in it should be shampooed once in two weeks and
brushed often, making it healthy and vigorous.</p>

<h4>MISSHAPEN HEADS</h4>

<p>It is wise to turn the baby first on one side and then on the
other and not allow him to sleep night after night on one side
of his head. The newborn head may be misshapen by laying
the child constantly on one side, and the ear may be misshapen
if it is allowed to curl under or become pressed forward. Markedly
protruding ears may be partially corrected by having the
child wear a well-ventilated cap made for the purpose.</p>

<h4>THE SALIVA</h4>

<p>Many mothers think that the presence of drooling or the excessive
flow of saliva is associated with teeth cutting. While
it may be associated with the teeth, this is not usually the case;
it is more probably due to the beginning of a new function of
secretion. The newborn baby has only enough saliva to furnish
moisture for the mouth, and not until the age of four
or five months does saliva really flow, and since the teeth
appear a bit later we often confuse the institution of a new
secretion with the oncoming teeth.</p>

<h4>SENSATIONS AND RECOGNITION</h4>

<p>The young baby manifests a number of sensations early in
its career. Hunger and satisfaction as well as comfort and
discomfort seem to be recognized by the little fellow. He
early learns that the approach of someone when he cries
usually means that he is to be taken up, and he usually
ceases crying as soon as he is taken up. He early manifests
a sense of comfort when he is cuddled; there also is early<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
present a manifestation of the desire to sleep, and the satisfying
pleasure of a drink of water.</p>

<p>At the age of three months he has recognized many things
such as the light or a bright object. He distinctly recognizes
his mother and often smiles at her approach. He recognizes
his hands at four months, and now begins to recognize other
members of the household aside from his mother. Even as
early as one month, he may smile at his mother. At two months
of age he will often smile at other members of the family. He
laughs out loud or chuckles during the fourth or fifth month.
But, on the whole, he must be considered as just a little animal
whose greatest needs are to have his appetite and thirst satisfied,
his little body clothed, and his little nerves put to rest&mdash;to sleep.</p>

<h4>SITTING ALONE</h4>

<p>At four months the normal baby will hold up his head; and
if he is supported at the back with a pillow, he will sit erectly&mdash;holding
his head up&mdash;at six months; while at eight months
or not later than nine, the normal child should sit alone on the
floor with no support. Later in the ninth month he often manifests
a desire to bear his weight upon his feet. Care is here
urged that the mother protect the little fellow at this time
and not allow him to rest his weight upon his feet but a
moment or two at a time.</p>

<p>He will reach for a ball suspended from the top of his
carriage or bed as early as the fifth month. About this time
he discovers his toes while in his bath. He will handle a
rattle at six or seven months, and shows delight in such toys.</p>

<h4>DENTITION</h4>

<p>In both the upper and lower jawbones of the newborn
infant there are hidden away in snug little cavities two sets
of tiny teeth; the first set, or milk teeth, and the second set,
or permanent teeth. These rudimentary teeth grow as the
baby grows and push their way up or down from the jawbones
until they finally make their appearance through the
gums. The milk teeth appear in a definite way and in five
definite groups.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span></p>

<p>There should be no physical disturbance at the appearance
of the teeth, which is a physiological process, and it is to be
deplored that all of the ills of babyhood are laid upon the
teeth with the careless remark: "Oh, its his teeth!" Many,
many illnesses are neglected because our inexperienced mother
has been told that she can expect "anything to happen when the
baby is cutting its teeth." Now, it is true that the babies of
many families do have trouble in cutting their teeth, but the
majority of babies cut their teeth comfortably and the first
knowledge anyone has of it is the appearance of the tooth itself.
As the teeth push their way nearer the surface of the gums,
there is a broadening and a hardening of the gums themselves,
and it is the exception rather than the rule that the baby needs
any help in cutting his teeth.</p>

<p>Usually by the time the baby is seven months old it has two
central teeth on the lower jaw (the central incisors), which
constitute the first group. The second group of teeth to appear
is the four upper central teeth which are all through by the
time the baby is twelve months old, and are often through at
ten months. Then there is a pause of from one to three months
before the next teeth appear&mdash;the four anterior molars. As
these four anterior molars come in, the two lateral incisors
appear on the lower jaw, which now gives us, by the time the
baby is fourteen or fifteen months old, four central teeth upper,
four central teeth lower, and the four anterior molars, which
make twelve teeth.</p>

<p>Another pause of two or three months and then we get the
four canine, which fill in the space between the first molars and
the front teeth. The canine on the upper jaw are commonly
known as the eye teeth, while the canine teeth on the lower
jaw are spoken of as the stomach teeth. This brings us to the
age of eighteen to twenty-four months, when there is still
another pause of two or three months, after which time the
big teeth or the four posterior molars appear, which completes
the first set of twenty teeth&mdash;the milk teeth. When baby is
twenty months old the milk teeth are often all in. The complete
set should appear not later than the thirtieth month.</p>

<p>During the life of the milk teeth the child should be taken<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
to the dentist at least once a year, better once in six months,
for all defective teeth must be properly and promptly cared for.
Inexpensive but sanitary fillings should be placed in all decayed
teeth, for the roots of the first teeth are very soft and infection
readily spreads to the jaws and the permanent teeth and
serious trouble often begins thus early.</p>

<p>If dentition is seriously delayed, investigation should be
started concerning the general condition of the child, for this
delay often accompanies ill health.</p>

<p>When the child is six years old, the mother should be watchful,
for it is at this time that the first permanent teeth appear
just behind the last molar of the milk teeth. They do not
replace any of the teeth present, and many times they come
through and decay without receiving any attention. It is seldom
necessary to assist these milk teeth as they come through
the gum, and should the gums become highly colored and
swollen it is not wise to lance them, for if the teeth are not
ready to come through immediately, the gum only toughens
the more and makes the real cutting still more painful.</p>

<p>This is the time to cut down the baby's food as well as to
look for other digestive disturbances, for the number of stools
may increase and vomiting may occur, and by reducing the
quantity and quality of the food and encouraging abundant
water drinking, much trouble may be avoided. Under no circumstances
urge the baby to eat when he refuses his food,
when the gums seem swollen and red during the teething time.
You will find that he will enjoy orange juice, pineapple juice,
or prune juice. All of these digestive symptoms are simply
the result of "feeling bad," and if heavy food of his regular
feeding is greatly diminished he will get along much better
than if fed his regular allowance of food.</p>

<h4>APPEARANCE OF THE TEETH</h4>

<p>The normal child has:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em;">
Six teeth at one year.<br />
Twelve teeth at one and one-half years.<br />
Sixteen teeth at two years.<br />
Twenty teeth at two and one-half years.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span></p>

<p>When the child is six years old the first permanent tooth
appears just back of the last of the milk teeth. By the time
he is seven, the four central teeth, two above and two below,
are out and the new ones begin to appear. The order of their
appearances is as follows:</p>

<table border="0" width="450" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="Teeth">

</table>

<h4>DENTAL SUGGESTIONS</h4>

<p>A better plan than to lance swollen gums is to rub them
gently with ice wrapped in a soft cloth, or to dip the finger in
ice water and rub the gums&mdash;this often gives the baby much
relief.</p>

<p>Often the baby finds comfort in biting on an ivory ring, but
the utmost care must be used in keeping it clean and avoiding
contamination by allowing it to drop on the floor.</p>

<p>Convulsions are never the symptoms of teething. Consult
a physician at once, as such seizures probably spring from
causes other than teething.</p>

<p>Cleansing of the teeth should be carried out systematically
every morning by means of a piece of cotton which has been
dipped in a boric-acid solution or a solution of bicarbonate of
soda (common baking soda). A soft brush may be used for
cleansing, and when there are particles of food between the teeth
they should be removed by strands of waxed floss.</p>

<p>Throughout life, frequent visits should be made to the dentist;
during early childhood days he should be on the lookout
for symptoms which indicate deformity&mdash;narrow jaws and
other conditions which affect the permanent teeth. During
adolescence and adult life the teeth should be examined every
six months and cleansings of the mouth should become a part
of the daily toilet.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span></p>

<h4>THE WEIGHT</h4>

<p>During the first year, nothing gives us so much information
concerning the child's general well-being as the weight. Such
a record will not only enlighten the mother concerning the
development of the child, but the grown-up child appreciates
the record and preserves it along with the other archives of
babyhood days. Every Sunday morning, when the father is
at home, the baby should be weighed and an accurate record
kept. It is important that the baby be weighed each time in
the same garments&mdash;shirt, band, diaper, and stockings&mdash;for
every ounce must be accounted for.</p>

<p>Until the baby is five or six months old he should gain from
four to eight ounces a week. Anything short of this is not
enough and should be reported to the physician. After six
months the gain is about a pound each month. This varies
somewhat; possibly during the tenth and eleventh month the
gain is lessened, but by the close of the first year the baby
should have trebled its birth weight.</p>

<p>Dr. Griffith gives us the following very interesting bit of
information concerning the weight of boys and girls after the
first year, and to him also belongs the credit for the accompanying
table showing the growth, height, and weight of the
child up to sixteen years of age.</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>After the first year we notice that, taking it all together, there is
a gradual increase in the number of pounds and a decrease in the
number of inches added yearly, four inches being gained in both
the second and third years, three inches in the fourth and fifth years,
and after this two inches a year. The gain in weight is four pounds
yearly from the age of three to that of seven years, then five, then
six, and then about nine pounds. It sometimes happens that at about
the age of nine in girls and eleven in boys there is almost a cessation
of growth for a short time. Later, at about twelve years, girls take
on a particularly rapid growth, and decidedly exceed boys of the
same age in weight, and sometimes in height also. At fifteen or
sixteen years the rapidity of growth in girls, both in weight and
height, will be greatly diminished, while boys of this age will often
begin to develop very rapidly, and will soon materially exceed the
other sex in both respects.</p></div><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span></p>

<h4>GENERAL DEVELOPMENT<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span></h4>

<p>The accompanying illustration (<a href="#illus-016">Fig. 14</a>), taken from Dr.
Yale, represents the developmental changes at one, five,
nine, thirteen, seventeen, and twenty-one years. Each figure
is divided into four equal parts, and as we watch the development
from the baby who at one year, as Dr. Yale says, is four
heads high, at the age of twenty-one the legs and the trunk have
much outgrown the growth of the head, so that at this age the
head is only two-thirteenths or less of the whole length of the
body. The legs have grown more rapidly and equal one-half
the entire body length. The trunk has not kept pace with the
legs, for as you will see from the diagram the line reaches
the navel of the child in one year, while in the adult it is much
lower. The rapid growth of the legs is accomplished after
nine years of age.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 14. Developmental Changes.</span>
</div>

<p>The proportions of the head, chest, and abdomen are exceedingly
important in the growing child. At the end of the first
year the head, chest, and abdomen are about uniform in circumference.
The head may measure one-fourth of an inch
more, but the chest and abdomen should both measure eighteen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
inches in circumference at this time. Should the head or the
abdomen be two inches larger than the chest; the attention
of the physician should be called to it, for either are indicative
of conditions that should be carefully investigated.</p>

<h4>NORMAL BREAST WEANING</h4>

<p>As a general rule the normal, healthy, breast-fed baby is
given a feeding of a bottle each day after he is ten months
old. These bottles are increased in number until, by the time
the baby is a year old, he is gradually weaned from the breast.
Should the ninth month of baby's life arrive in the hot summer
months we urge the mothers to continue breast feeding, with
possibly the addition of some fruit juices, as noted elsewhere,
until early autumn. Under no circumstances should the baby be
weaned and compelled to use cow's milk during the season of
the year when the risks of contamination are greatest. If the
baby is nursed up to the close of his first year he hardly need
be trained to use the bottle, but may take his food from a cup.
From one to two months should always be consumed in weaning
the baby, unless sudden weaning is necessitated by ill
health, as noted elsewhere. The baby should have, if possible,
from thirty to forty days to accustom himself to cow's milk
exclusively.</p>

<p>If the child is weaned slowly there should be no trouble with
the breasts, but in the instance of sudden weaning the mother
should restrict her liquids, put on a tight breast binder, and
for a day or two should take a dose of a saline cathartic,
which will assist in taking care of the liquids and thus decrease
the secretion of milk.</p>

<h4>NORMAL BOTTLE WEANING</h4>

<p>If the bottle food is agreeing with the baby he should be
allowed to use it up to the end of the first year when he will
be given whole milk with possibly the addition of a little lime
water. We see no reason why the child should give up his
bottle during the second year unless other food is refused&mdash;unless
he will not accept other food than from his bottle&mdash;and
if you are convinced that he has formed the "bottle habit,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
then the milk should be put into a tiny cup or glass, and he
should learn to sip it along with his solid foods; but if he takes
his other foods without any hesitancy, then we know no reason
why he should not take his milk in this comfortable manner
from his bottle at least two or three feedings each day.</p>

<p>If you desire to wean him from his bottle, serve the first part
of it with a spoon from a cup or glass and then give him the
remainder in the bottle. The beautiful picture of a big, robust
baby lying on his back, knees flexed, both hands holding his
beloved bottle still lingers in my mind as one of the pleasant
memories of my lad's babyhood days, and at the close of the
second year, when the beloved bottle was left behind, I believe
I missed something as well as did the lad.</p>

<p>I recall no difficulty with his taking the food from a cup.
The success of all normal weanings is due entirely to the fact
that it is done gradually and slowly, and under no circumstances
should it be roughly and abruptly attempted&mdash;particularly
in case of the bottle feeding.</p>

<h4>TRAINING THE BOWELS AND BLADDER</h4>

<p>Reference is made to this subject in another part of this
book&mdash;where we went into the detail of keeping the daily record
of these physiological occurrences&mdash;and it was found that the
bowels moved and the bladder was emptied at about the same
time each day. Any mother, caretaker, or nurse, who will take
the time to keep a daily record of the hours of defecation and
urination, will observe the time carefully and will catch the
child on nearly every occasion before an accident occurs. Often
as early as four months the bowels will move in an infant's
chamber at regular times each day. The nurse or mother
places this receptacle in her lap and holds the child gently and
carefully upon it. A little later it can be made to sit on a special
chair prepared for the purpose, and at eight or nine months
by careful training the urination can be controlled, and by the
end of the first year the diapers ought to be discontinued.</p>

<p>If the child has not learned to control the bladder by the
age of two years, medical attention should be called to the
fact and remedial measures instituted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span></p>

<h4>BABY'S SPEECH</h4>

<p>The baby should begin to talk at one year. He early learns
to say "mamma" and "papa," and gradually adds nouns to
his vocabulary, so that at eighteen months the normal child
should have a vocabulary of one hundred to one hundred and
fifty words. As he nears the two-year mark, he has acquired
a few simple verbs and he can possibly put three words together,
such as, "Willie wants drink." Pronouns come in late, as we
all recall that the young child usually speaks of himself by
his own name.</p>

<p>Children are born mimics. If you talk baby talk to them,
they will talk baby talk back. For instance, a well known
author told us just the other day that for many years no other
name was given to the sewing machine in his house but the
word "mafinge," and not until he went to school did he correct
the word "bewhind," for in the nursery he learned the
line "wagging their tails bewhind them." Baby talk is very
cunning, and often the adult members of the family pick it up
and keep it up for years, and only when they are exposed in
public, as one mother was on a suburban platform by her
four-year-old lad shouting, "Mamma, too-too tain tumin, too-too
tain tumin," do they sense their responsibility and realize
how difficult it is to form new habits. This poor mother tried
in vain to have her little fellow say, as did another little lad
two and one-half years old, "Mother, the train's coming; let's
get on."</p>

<p>Many words of our beloved language at best are hard to
understand; so let us speak correct English to the little folks
and they will reward us by speaking good English in return.</p>

<p>If at two years the child makes no attempt at speech, suspicions
should be aroused concerning mutism or other serious
nervous defects. Medical advice should be sought.</p>

<h4>DEFECTIVE SPEECH</h4>

<p>All guttural tones which may be occasioned by adenoids or
enlarged tonsils, all lisping, stuttering, or defective speech of
all words should be taken in hand at the very start, as they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
are usually overcome by constant repetition of the correct
manner of speaking the particular word in question. Children
of defective speech need special training, and should in no way
be allowed rapidly to repeat little nursery rhymes, as oftentimes
this rapid repetition of rhymes by a child with hereditary
nervous defects may occasion stuttering or stammering later on.</p>

<h4>CALISTHENICS</h4>

<p>Special exercise should not be forced upon young children.
Physical culture, along with many other things intended for
sedentary adults, should never be forced upon little folks who
get all of the exercise they need in the many journeys they
take building their blocks, sailing their boats, tearing down
imaginary houses, making imaginary journeys&mdash;from morning
until night the little feet are kept busy&mdash;never stopping
until the sandman comes at sleepy time. Do not yourself
attempt to stimulate a child who seems backward. Consult your
physician. You had much better put a child out to grow up
in the yard by himself with his sandpile than to force calisthenics
or advance physical training upon him.</p>

<h4>BOW LEGS AND WALKING</h4>

<p>Do not attempt to hasten nature in aiding the child to walk.
Let him creep, roll, slide, or even hunch along the floor&mdash;wait
until he pulls himself to his feet and gradually acquires the art
of standing alone. If he is overpersuaded to take "those cute
little steps" it may result in bow legs, and then&mdash;pity on him
when he grows up. Sometimes flat foot is the result of early
urging the child to rest the weight of the body upon the undeveloped
arch. A defect in the gait or a pigeon toe is hard to
bear later on in life. A certain amount of pigeon-toeing is
natural and normal. If the baby is heavy he will not attempt
to walk at twelve months. He will very likely wait until fourteen
or fifteen months. The lighter-weight children sometimes
walk as early as eleven months, but they should all be walking
at eighteen months, and if not, it is usually indicative of backward
mentality.</p>

<p>If the training of the bowels and bladder will replace the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
diapers with drawers, the baby will attempt to walk sooner than
when encumbered with a bunglesome bunch of diaper between
the thighs. The little fellow runs alone at sixteen months and
thoroughly enjoys it, and the wise mother will pay no attention
to the small bumps which are going to come plentifully at this
particular time.</p>

<h4>SUMMARY OF BABY'S DEVELOPMENT</h4>

<p>He discovers his hands at three or four months. At six
months he sits alone, plays with simple objects, grasps for
objects, and laughs aloud from the third to the fifth month.
He says "goo goo" at four or five months. At one year he
should stand with support, listen to a watch tick, follow moving
objects, know his mother, play little games, such as rolling
a ball, should have trebled his birth weight, and have at
least six teeth, and should use three words in short sentences.
At eighteen months he should say "mamma" spontaneously,
walk and run without support, should have quite a vocabulary,
should be able to perform small errands like "pick up the book,"
and should have twelve to sixteen teeth. At two years he
should be interested in pictures, able to talk intelligently, and
know where his eyes, nose, mouth, hands, and feet are. At
three years, he should enumerate the objects in a picture, tell
his surname, and repeat a sentence with six words.</p>

<p>In the case of a premature baby or a very delicate child, or
as a result of a prolonged illness or a very severe sickness,
such as spinal meningitis, the time of these mental and physical
developments may all be postponed, while rickets, which
will be spoken of later, is often the cause of late sitting, late
standing, and late walking.</p>

<h4>DIET AFTER THE FIRST YEAR</h4>

<p>Milk is the principal article of diet during the second year.
It should be given with regularity at distinct intervals of four
meals a day. It may be given from the nursing bottle, unless
the child has acquired the bottle habit and refuses to eat anything
else but the food from his bottle, in which case it should
be given from a cup. Beginning with the sixth month, aside<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
from his milk, be it breast milk or bottle milk, he is to be
given orange juice once each day as well as the broth from
spinach and other vegetables. This is necessary to give the
child certain salts which are exceedingly essential to the bottle
baby.</p>

<p>At the close of the year when he is taking whole milk he
should be given arrowroot cracker, strained apple sauce, prune
pulp, fig pulp, mashed ripe banana (mashed with a knife), a
baked potato with sauce or gravy (avoiding condiments), and
a coddled egg. Fruit juices may be added to the diet, such as
grape, pineapple, peach, and pear juice. Later in the second
year he may be given stale bread and butter, and for desserts
he may have cup custard, slightly sweetened junket, and such
fruit desserts as baked apple and baked pear.</p>

<p>We do not think it is necessary to give children much meat
or meat juices. We appreciate that there is a diversity of
opinion upon this subject, but we do not hesitate to say that
in the families where meat is little used, the children seem to
grow up in the normal manner with sound healthy bodies,
sometimes having never tasted it. When meat is used, it should
be well cooked to avoid contamination with such parasites as
tapeworm and trichina; it should also be well chewed before
swallowing, as many of the intestinal disturbances of the older
children are due to the swallowing of unmasticated food such
as half-chewed banana, chunks of meat, rinds of fruit, and the
skins of baked potatoes.</p>

<p>Let the children's diet be simply planned, well cooked, thoroughly
masticated, and above all things have regular meal
hours, and no "piecing" between meals; and if the mother
begins thus early with her little fellow, she will be rewarded
some later day by hearing him say to some well-meaning neighbor,
who has just given him a delicious cookie or a bit of
candy: "Thank you, I will keep it until meal time." Children
learn one of the greatest lessons of self control in following
the teaching that nothing should pass the lips between
meals but water or a fruit-ade. Children in the second year
require four meals a day, one of which is usually only the
bottle or a cup of milk. These meals are usually taken at six,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
ten, two, and six in the evening. Oftentimes this early six
o'clock meal is just a bottle or cup of milk, as may also be the
evening meal.</p>

<h4>CANDY</h4>

<p>Now, a word about candy. Pure candy is wholesome and
nourishing. It is high in calorific value, and children should
be allowed to have it if it does not enter the stomach in solutions
stronger than ten or fifteen per cent. We can see at a
glance that chocolate creams, bonbons, and other soft candies
should never be given to children. Candies that they can
suck, such as fruit tablets, stick candy, sunshine candy, and
other hard confections that are pure, and free from mineral
colorings and other concoctions such as are commonly used
in the cheaper candies, may safely be given at the close of
the meals&mdash;but never between meals.</p>

<p>All such articles as tea, coffee, beer, soft candies, condiments,
pastries, and fried foods, should be positively avoided in
the case of all children under five and six years of age.</p>

<p>The diet from now on will be considered in the chapter

<h2>CHAPTER XXV</h2>
<h2>THE SICK CHILD</h2>
</div>

<p>To the mother who has passed through the experience of
bringing the child into the world is usually given that
intuitiveness which helps her in caring for that child when it
is well and in recognizing certain symptoms when it is sick.
The newborn baby brings with him a large responsibility, but
as the weeks pass by his care becomes less and less of a nervous
strain, as the routine duties, so nearly alike each day of his
little life, have made the task comparatively easy; but when the
baby gets sick, particularly if he is under one year of age, and
it is impossible for him clearly to make known his wants, and
being unable to tell where it hurts or how badly it hurts, the
average mother is likely to become somewhat panicky; and
this confusion of mind often renders her quite unfit successfully
to nurse the sick baby.</p>

<h4>THE NURSE</h4>

<p>It is often wise to secure the services of a trained nurse,
and if the family purse will allow such services, a good, sincere,
capable, practical nurse should be engaged, for her firm
kindness will often accomplish much more than the unintentional
irritability and anxious solicitude of an overworked and
nervous mother.</p>

<p>Usually the mother not only attempts the care of the sick
baby with the long night vigil&mdash;often not having the opportunity
to take a bath or change her raiment day in and day
out&mdash;but she often attempts to manage the entire household<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
as well, including the getting of the meals and keeping the
house cleaned, and it is not to be wondered at that her nerves
become overtaxed and in an unlooked for moment she becomes
irritable and cross with the sick child.</p>

<p>No matter how low the financial conditions of the family may
be, outside help is always essential in cases of severe or long-continued
illness of the children. Should the mother insist
upon caring for the baby herself, then all household duties
should be given over to outside help, and as she takes the r&ocirc;le
of the nurse, the same daily outing and sleep that an outside
nurse would receive should be hers to enjoy.</p>

<p>Dr. Griffith has so ably detailed the "features of disease"
that we can do no better than to quote the following:<a name="fnanchor_3" id="fnanchor_3"></a><a href="#footnote_3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<div class="blockquot"><h4>POSITION</h4>

<p>The position assumed in sickness is a matter of importance. A
child feverish or in pain is usually very restless even when asleep.
When awake it desires constantly to be taken up, put down again,
or carried about. Sometimes, however, at the beginning of an acute
disease it lies heavy and stupid for a long time. In prolonged illnesses
and in severe acute disorders the great exhaustion is shown
by the child lying upon its back, with its face turned toward the
ceiling, in a condition of complete apathy. It may remain like a log,
scarcely breathing for days before death takes place. Perfect immobility
may also be seen in children who are entirely unconscious
although not exhausted.</p>

<p>A constant tossing off of the covers at night occurs early in
rickets, but, of course, is seen in many healthy infants, especially if
they are too warmly covered. A baby shows a desire to be propped
up with pillows or to sit erect or to be carried in the mother's arms
with its head over her shoulder whenever breathing is much interfered
with, as in diphtheria of the larynx and in affections of the
heart and lungs. The constant assumption of one position or the
keeping of one part of the body still, may indicate paralysis. When,
however, a cry attends a forcible change of position, it shows that
the child was still because movement caused pain.</p>

<p>Sleeping with the mouth open and the head thrown back often
attends chronic enlargement of the tonsils and the presence of
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>adenoid growths in young children, although it may be seen in other
affections which make breathing difficult. In inflammation of the
brain the head is often drawn far back and held stiffly so. Sometimes,
too, in this disease the child lies upon one side with the back
arched, the knees drawn up, and the arms crossed over the chest.
A constant burying of the face in the pillow or in the mother's
lap occurs in severe inflammation of the eyes.</p>

<h4>GESTURES</h4>

<p>The gestures are often indicative of disease. Babies frequently
place the hands near the seat of pain; thus in slight inflammation
of the mouth they tend to put the hand in the mouth; in earache
to move it to the ear; and in headache to raise it to the head.
In headache or in affections of the brain they sometimes pluck at
the hair or the ears, although they may often do this when there
is no such trouble. Picking at the nose or at the opening
of the bowel is seen in irritation of the intestine from worms or
oftener from other cause. A child with a painful disease of its
chest may sometimes place its hand on its abdomen, or a hungry
child try to put its fists into its mouth.</p>

<p>In approaching convulsions the thumbs are often drawn tightly
into the palms of the hands and the toes are stiffly bent or straightened.
Very young babies, however, tend to do this, although
healthy. The alternate doubling up and straightening of the body,
with squirming movements, making of fists, kicking, and crying,
are indications of colic. This is especially true if the symptoms
come on suddenly and disappear as suddenly, perhaps attended
by the expulsion of gas from the bowel.</p>

<h4>SKIN COLOR</h4>

<p>The color of the skin is often altered in disease. It is yellow in
jaundice, and is bluish, especially over the face, in congenital heart
disease. There is a purplish tint around the eyes and mouth, with
a prominence of the veins of the face, in weakly children or in those
with disordered digestion. A pale circle around the mouth accompanies
nausea. The skin frequently acquires an earthy hue in
chronic diarrhea, and is pale in any condition in which the blood
is impoverished, as in Bright's disease, rickets, consumption, or
any exhausted state. Flushing of the face accompanies fever, but
besides this there is often seen a flushing without fever in older
children the subjects of chronic disorders of digestion. Sudden
flushing or paling is sometimes seen in disease of the brain.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span></p>

<h4>FACIAL EXPRESSION</h4>

<p>The expression of the face varies with the disease. In whooping
cough and measles the face is swollen and somewhat flushed, giving
the child a heavy, stupid expression. There is also swelling of the
face, especially about the eyes, in Bright's disease. Repeated momentary
crossing of the eyes often indicates approaching convulsions.
In very severe acute diarrhea it is astonishing with what
rapidity the face will become sunken and shriveled, and so covered
with deep lines that the baby is almost unrecognizable. The same
thing occurs more slowly in the condition commonly known as
marasmus. Often the face has an expression of distress in the
beginning of any serious disease. If the edges of the nostrils move
in and out with breathing, we may suspect some difficulty of respiration,
such as attends pneumonia. The baby sleeps with its eyes
half open in exhausted conditions or when suffering pain.</p>

<h4>THE HEAD</h4>

<p>The head exhibits certain noteworthy features. Excessive perspiration
when sleeping is an early symptom of rickets. It must be
remembered, however, that any debilitated child may perspire more
or less when asleep. Both in rickets and in hydrocephalus (water
on the brain) the face seems small and the head large, but in the
former the head is square and flat on top, while in the latter it is
of a somewhat globular shape. The fontanelle is prominent and
throbs forcibly in inflammation of the brain, is too large in rickets
and hydrocephalus, bulges in the latter affection, and sometimes
sinks in conditions with only slight debility.</p>

<h4>THE CHEST</h4>

<p>The chest exhibits a heaving movement with a drawing in of the
spaces between the ribs in any disease in which breathing is difficult.
A chicken-breasted chest is seen in Pott's disease of the spine,
and to some extent in bad cases of enlargement of the tonsillar
tissue; a "violin-shaped" chest in rickets; a bulging of one side in
pleurisy with fluid; and a long, narrow chest, with a general flattening
of the upper part, in older children predisposed to consumption.</p>

<h4>THE ABDOMEN</h4>

<p>The abdomen is swollen and hard in colic. It is also much distended
with gas in rickets, and is constantly so in chronic indiges<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>tion
in later childhood. It is usually much sunken in inflammation
of the brain or in severe exhausting diarrhea or marasmus. It
may be distended with liquid in some cases of dropsy.</p>

<h4>THE CRY</h4>

<p>The study of the cry furnishes one of the most valuable means
of learning what ails a baby. A persistent cry may be produced by
the intense, constant itching of eczema.</p>

<p>The paroxysmal cry, very severe for a time and then ceasing absolutely,
is probably due to colic, particularly if accompanied by the
distention of the abdomen and the movements of the body already
referred to. A frequent, peevish, whining cry is heard in children
with general poor health or discomfort. A single shrill scream
uttered now and then is often heard in inflammation of the brain.
In any disease in which there is difficulty in getting enough air into
the lungs, as in pneumonia, the cry is usually very short and the
child cries but little, because it cannot hold its breath long enough
for it. A nasal cry occurs with cold in the head.</p>

<p>A short cry immediately after coughing indicates that the cough
hurts the chest. Crying when the bowels are moved shows that
there is pain at that time. A child of from two to six years, waking
at night with violent screaming, is probably suffering from night
terrors. In conditions of very great weakness and exhaustion the
baby moans feebly, or it may twist its face into the position for
crying, but emit no sound at all. This latter is also true in some
cases of inflammation of the larynx, while in other cases the cry
is hoarse or croupy. Crying when anything goes into the mouth
makes one suspect some trouble there. If it occurs with swallowing,
it is probable that the throat is inflamed.</p>

<p>With the act of crying there ought always to be tears in children
over three or four months of age. If there are none, serious disease
is indicated, and their reappearance is then a good sign.</p>

<h4>COUGHING</h4>

<p>The character of the cough is also instructive. A frequent, loud,
nearly painless cough, at first tight and later loose, is heard in bronchitis.
A short, tight, suppressed cough, which is followed by a
grimace, and, perhaps, by a cry, indicates some inflammation about
the chest, often pneumonia. There is a brazen, barking, "croupy"
cough in spasmodic croup. In inflammation of the larynx, including
true croup, the cough may be hoarse, croupy, or sometimes
almost noiseless.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span></p>

<p>The cough of whooping cough is so peculiar that it must be described
separately when considering this disease. Then there are
certain coughs which are purely nervous or dependent upon remote
affections. Thus the so-called "stomach cough" is caused by some
irritation of the stomach or bowels. It is not nearly so frequent as
mothers suppose. Irritation about the nose or the canal of the
ears sometimes induces a cough in a similar way. Enlarged tonsils
or elongated palate or throat irritation may also produce a cough.</p>

<h4>THE BREATHING</h4>

<p>The breathing of a young child, particularly if under one year
of age and awake, is always slightly irregular. If it becomes very
decidedly so, we suspect disease, particularly of the brain. A combination
of long pauses, lasting half a minute or a minute, with
breathing which is at first very faint, gradually becomes more and
more deep, and then slowly dies away entirely, goes by the name of
"Cheyne-Stokes respiration," and is found in affections of the brain.
It is one of the worst of symptoms except in infancy, and even then
it is very serious.</p>

<p>The rate of respiration is increased in fever in proportion to the
height of the temperature. It is increased also by pain in rickets,
and especially in some affections of the lungs. Sixty respirations a
minute are not at all excessive for a child of two years with pneumonia,
and the speed is frequently decidedly greater than this.</p>

<p>Breathing is often very slow in disease of the brain, particularly
tubercular meningitis. Poisoning by opiates produces the same
effect. Frequent deep sighing or yawning occurs in affections of the
brain, in faintness, or in great exhaustion, and may be a very unfavorable
symptom. Breathing entirely through the mouth shows
that the nose is completely blocked, while snuffling breathing is the
result of a partial catarrhal obstruction. A gurgling in the throat
not accompanied by cough may indicate that there is mucus in the
back part of it, the result of an inflammation, sometimes slight,
sometimes serious.</p>

<p>"Labored" breathing, in which the chest is pulled up with each
breath while the muscles of the neck become tense, the pit of the
stomach and the spaces between the ribs sink in, and the edges of
the nostrils move in and out, is seen in conditions where the natural
ease of respiration is greatly interfered with, as in pneumonia,
diphtheria of the larynx, asthma, and the like. Long-drawn, noisy
inspirations and expirations are heard in obstruction of the larynx,
as from laryngeal diphtheria or spasmodic croup.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span></p>

<h4>THE PULSE</h4>

<p>The rate of the pulse is subject to such variations in infants that
its examination is of less value than it would otherwise be. In
early childhood its observation is of more service, although even
then deceptive. Slight irregularity is not uncommon. Unusual
irregularity is an important symptom in affections of the brain or
heart. Fever produces an increase in the pulse rate, the degree of
which depends, as a rule, upon the height of the temperature. Slowing
of the pulse is a very significant symptom, seen particularly in
affections of the brain, and sometimes in Bright's disease and jaundice.</p>

<h4>THE TEMPERATURE</h4>

<p>The temperature is of all things important to remember in infancy
and childhood because fever is easily produced and runs high from
slight causes.</p>

<p>Even slight cold or the presence of constipation or slight disturbances
of digestion may in babies sometimes produce a
temperature of 103 F. or more. We do not speak of fever unless
the elevation reaches 100 F. A temperature of 102 or 103 F. constitutes
moderate fever, while that of 104 or 105 F. is high fever,
and above 105 F. very high. A temperature of 107 F. is very dangerous,
and is usually not recovered from. The danger from fever
depends not only upon its height, but upon its duration also. An
elevation of 105 F. may be easily borne for a short time, but it
becomes alarming if much prolonged.</p>

<h4>THE MOUTH</h4>

<p>The tongue of newborn infants is generally whitish and continues
to be so until the saliva becomes plentiful. After this we usually find
it coated in disturbances of the stomach and bowels and in nearly
any disorder accompanied by fever. In scarlet fever the tongue
becomes bright red after a few days, and in measles and whooping
cough it is often faintly bluish. In the latter affection an ulcer may
sometimes be found directly under the tongue, where the thin membrane
binds it to the floor of the mouth. In thrush the tongue is
covered with white patches like curdled milk. A pale, flabby tongue,
marked by the teeth at its edges, indicates debility or impaired digestion.
In prolonged or very high fever the tongue grows dry, and
in some diseases of the stomach or bowels it may look like raw
beef.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span></p>

<p>Grinding of the teeth is a frequent symptom in infants in whom
dentition has commenced. It generally indicates an irritated nervous
system. Most often this depends upon some disturbance of digestion;
less often upon the presence of worms. The symptom is present
during or preceding a convulsion, and may occur, too, in disease
of the brain. In some babies it appears to be only a nervous
habit.</p>

<h4>NURSING</h4>

<p>The manner of nursing or swallowing frequently affords important
information. A baby whose nose is much obstructed or who
has pneumonia can nurse but for a moment, and then has to let the
nipple go in order to breathe more satisfactorily. If it gives a few
sucks and then drops the nipple with a cry, we must suspect that the
mouth is sore and that nursing is painful. If it swallows with a
gurgling noise, often stops to cough, and does as little nursing as
possible, we suspect that the throat may be sore. The ceasing to
nurse at all, in the case of a very sick baby, is an evidence of great
weakness or increasing stupor, and is a most unfavorable symptom.</p>

<h4>THE URINE</h4>

<p>Urine that is high-colored and stains the diaper, or that shows a
thick, reddish cloud after standing, may accompany fever or indigestion.
Sometimes the urine under these conditions is milky when
first passed. In some babies a diet containing beef juice or other
highly nitrogenous food will produce the reddish cloud, or even
actual, red, sandlike particles. A decidedly yellow stain on the
diaper occurs when there is jaundice. A faint reddish stain seldom
indicates blood. The amount of urine passed is scanty in fever, in
diarrhea, and especially in acute Bright's disease. In the latter disease
the urine is often of a smoky or even a muddy appearance.
The possibility of the occurrence of this symptom after scarlet fever
must always be kept in mind, in order that a physician may be summoned
very quickly, since it is a serious matter.</p>

<h4>THE STOOLS</h4>

<p>We find that the passages are often putty-colored in disorders of
the liver, frequently bloody or tarry in appearance in bleeding within
the bowel, and liable to be black after taking bismuth, charcoal, or
iron, and red after krameria, kino, or haematoxylon. Infants who
are receiving more milk than they can digest constantly have whitish
lumps in their stools, or even entirely formed but almost white<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
passages. The presence of a certain amount of greenish coloration
of the passages is not infrequent. This is usually an evidence of
indigestion, but passages which are yellow when passed and turn to
a faint pea green some time later are not an indication of disease.</p></div>

<p class="footnote"><a name="footnote_3" id="footnote_3"></a><a href="#fnanchor_3"><sup>3</sup></a>&nbsp;From Griffith's <i>Care of the Baby</i>, copyrighted by W. B. Saunders Company.</p>

<h4>WHEN BABY GETS SICK</h4>

<p>When baby shows that he is sick, take his temperature as
directed elsewhere, cut down the feeding to at least one half,
or, if his temperature is around 102 F. give him nothing but
rice water or barley water. If he is constipated give him a
cleansing enema, and if hot and feverish a sponge bath may
be administered. He should then be put into a bed with light
covers and wait further orders which the doctor will give on
his arrival. Give the baby no medicine unless ordered to do
so by the physician.</p>

<p>Known to every physician who undertakes the care of children,
is the failure of many well-meaning mothers to call him
early. The mother attempts the care of the baby herself, and
not until the condition gets beyond her knowledge and wisdom
does she seek medical advice. In the early hours of an approaching
cold, the beginning of intestinal indigestion, or at
the beginning of bronchitis, if the physician can see the child
early, prolonged illness may be avoided as well as unnecessary
expense and many heart-breaking experiences.</p>

<h4>FEEDING THE SICK BABY</h4>

<p>Feeding the sick baby differs somewhat with the character
of the individual disease, but in the outset of any and all diseases
the intestinal tract should not be overburdened with
food. At the approach of any illness, the food should at least
be cut down one half; for instance, in the case of a serious
acute illness accompanied by fever, not only should the strength
of the food be reduced one half, but water should be given
plentifully between feedings. It is better never to urge the
baby to eat at such times&mdash;for the ability to digest food is
very much reduced.</p>

<p>In cases of acute attacks with much vomiting and fever,
all milk should be immediately stopped and rice water or bar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>ley
water substituted. When vomiting ceases and the fever
approaches normal and food is desired, begin with boiled skim
milk in small amounts, well diluted with cereal water, and do
not approach the normal amount of milk for twenty-four to
forty-eight hours. In this way the weak digestive organs are
not overtaxed and they gradually resume their usual work of
good digestion. When a baby seems to have no appetite for
food, lengthen the intervals from three to four or five hours,
for feeding when food is not desired usually aggravates disease
disturbances.</p>

<h4>EXAMINING SICK CHILDREN</h4>

<p>And now, above all times, the early seed sowing of teaching
the child self-control, teaching him to gargle if he is sufficiently
old enough, to open his mouth and allow observation
without resistance, brings sure results. The great harm of
making the doctor and his medicine a threat to obtain obedience
also brings its harvest at this time; for the doctor, of all
people, ought to be regarded as the child's best friend. When
baby is sick, the doctor is needed, his daily visits must not
be resisted, his medicines must not be feared&mdash;these and such
other matters should be made a part of every child's early
education.</p>

<p>Under no circumstances or conditions should we directly
falsify to a child. Nothing is accomplished by telling a
child it will not hurt when you know that it will hurt, or that
the medicine tastes good when you know it is bad-tasting.
Every physician can recall unnecessary disturbances in the
office because a mother has allowed a child to acquire a wrong
mental attitude toward the family physician.</p>

<p>One mother told her little girl in my office when I wished to
make an examination for adenoids which necessitated my putting
my finger back of the child's uvula, "Now Mary, the doctor
won't hurt you at all, it will feel nice." I turned to the little
girl and said: "Mary, it will not feel nice, it really won't hurt
you, but it will feel uncomfortable." It was a grave mistake
to tell her that it would feel nice. The child resisted, and,
while the examination was successfully made, the greatest of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
tact had to be used in securing the friendship of the child after
the examination.</p>

<p>It is far better when the throat is to be examined to wrap
the child in a shawl or a sheet with his arms placed at his
side, and for a member of the family to take him in her lap
and hold him securely while the physician quickly makes the
observation. And while we appreciate that sickness is not the
time to introduce new methods of training, in instances where
children have been spoiled, it is far better quietly and firmly
to go about the task in a manner that you know can be carried
through to a successful finish.</p>

<h4>TREATMENT OF SICK CHILDREN</h4>

<p>A sick child should be encouraged to lie in his bed much of
the time, and the bed should be kept clean and cool. He should
never be set up suddenly or laid back quickly. In the case of
a broken leg, all rapid movements should be avoided. A simple
story or a soothing lullaby, or the giving of a toy, will
often divert attention when some painful movement must be
made or some disagreeable task performed.</p>

<p>Both cleanliness of the body and cleanliness of the mouth
are exceedingly necessary in sickness. In all instances of disease
or indisposition, the mouth must receive daily care, for
stomatitis or gangrene of the mouth often follows neglect. A
listerine wash in proportion of one to four, or a magnesia
wash, or the addition of a few drops of essence of cinnamon
to the mouth wash will do much to prevent such conditions,
as well as to relieve them.</p>

<p>Applications of medicine to the throat may be made without
resistance if the tactful nurse watches her time. She should
slowly introduce the tongue depressor which may be a flat
stick or a spoon, when the application of medicine with a
camel's-hair brush is quickly made to the rolled-out throat as the
child gags, and if the nurse then quickly diverts his attention
to some beautiful story or a picture or a new toy, the treatment
is soon forgotten. Under no circumstances argue with or
scold a sick child. Get everything ready, if possible behind his
back or in another room, and then with plenty of help make the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
application or the observation without words, always with
gentleness and firmness.</p>

<h4>NURSING RECORDS</h4>

<p>Whether the nurse be the mother, caretaker, practical or
professional nurse, a record should always be kept of the condition
of the patient. The temperature should be reported at
different periods designated by the physician. The pulse should
be recorded, the amount of urine passed and the time it was
passed, the number of bowel movements, all feedings and the
general well being of the child&mdash;whether it is restless or comfortable,
sleeping or awake, together with the water that he
drinks.</p>

<p>The record may be kept, if necessary, on a piece of common
letter paper, and should read something like this:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>March 26, 1916</p>

<p>7 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span> Temperature 102; pulse 132; respiration 40; morning

<p>A record like this is a great help to the physician, and such
a record may be kept by anyone who can read and write.
There are printed record blanks which may be procured from
any medical supply house and most drug stores.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span></p>

<h4>BAD-TASTING MEDICINES</h4>

<p>Castor oil has neither a pleasant smell nor taste, and nothing
is accomplished by telling the child that it does smell good
or taste good. If the patient is old enough to drink from a
cup, put in a layer of orange juice and then the castor oil and
then another layer of orange juice, and in this way it often
can be easily taken. Someone has suggested that a piece of ice
held in the mouth just before the medicine is taken will often
make a bad dose go down without so much forcing. A taste
of currant jelly, or a bit of sweet chocolate, or the chewing
of a stick of cinnamon is a great adjunct to the administration
of bad-tasting medicines. All oily medicines must be
kept in a cool place and should always be given in spoons or
from medicine glasses that have first been dipped in very cold
water. Very often the addition of sugar to bad-tasting medicines
will in no wise interfere with their action, while it often
facilitates the administration of the disagreeable dose. The
majority of bad-tasting medicines are now put up in the form
of chocolate-flavored candy tablets.</p>

<h4>TEMPERATURES AND PULSE</h4>

<p>The normal temperature of a baby is 98.5 to 99 F. in the
rectum. After shaking the mercury of the thermometer down
below the 97 mark it is well lubricated with vaseline and then
carefully, gently, pushed into the rectum for about an inch and
a half or two inches, and left there for three minutes before
removing.</p>

<p>Mothers should exercise self-control in taking the temperature,
for nothing is gained by allowing a panicky fear to seize
you should the mercury register higher than you anticipated.
Notify your physician when the temperature registers above
100 F.</p>

<p>The respirations of a child are fairly regular and rhythmic
and occur about forty times per minute during the first month
of life and about thirty times per minute during the remainder
of the year. From one to two years, twenty-six to twenty-eight
is the average. Breathing is somewhat irregular when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
the child is awake and may be a bit slower when asleep. Before
the baby is born the fetal pulse is about 150. At birth it ranges
from 130 to 140. During the first month the pulse is found
to be from 120 to 140. By the sixth month it gets down to
120 or 130, and from that on to a year the normal pulse beat
of the baby is about 120. The pulse is influenced very much by
exercise and is often increased by crying or nursing or any
other excitement.</p>

<h4>FEVER</h4>

<p>Children get fever very easily&mdash;the digestive disturbance of
overeating, constipation, a slight bilious attack&mdash;all produce
fever which disappears quite as suddenly as it came. The first
thing to do under such circumstances is to withhold food, give
plenty of water to drink, produce a brisk movement of the
bowel by giving a dose of castor oil, give a cleansing enema,
and treat the fever as follows:</p>

<p>After removing all of the clothes from the child, place him
in a warm blanket and then prepare a sponge bath which
may be equal parts of alcohol and water; expose one portion
of the body at a time and apply the water and alcohol first to
one arm and then to the other arm, the chest, one leg, the
other leg, the back and then the buttocks. Do not dry the part
but allow evaporation to take place, and this, accompanied by
the cooling of the blood which is brought to the skin by the
friction, readily reduces the fever. Another procedure which
may be employed if the fever registers high is the wet-sheet
pack which is administered as follows:</p>

<p>Three thicknesses of wool blankets are placed on the bed
and a sheet as long as the baby and just enough to wrap
around him once, is wrung out of cool water and spread over
these blankets. With a hot-water bottle to the feet, the child
is then laid down in the wet sheet which is now brought in
contact with every portion of his body, then the blankets are
quickly brought around, and he is allowed to warm up the
sheet&mdash;which lowers his temperature.</p>

<p>Another valuable procedure is the cooling enema. Water
the same temperature as that of the body, is allowed to enter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
the bowel and is then quickly cooled down to 90 or 85 F.; in this
manner much heat is taken out of the body and the fever
quickly reduced. (For further treatment of fevers see <a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a>.)</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVI</h2>
<h2>BABY'S SICK ROOM</h2>
</div>

<p>Visitors should never be allowed in the sick room during
the height of a disease, and during convalescence not
more than one visitor should be allowed at one time, and the
visit then should be only two or three minutes in length. The
order and the quietness and the system of the sick room
should be perfect. Visitors and loitering members of the
family do no good and they may do much harm to the recuperating
nervous system of the child.</p>

<h4>LOCATION OF THE SICK ROOM</h4>

<p>In these days of high rents, we realize that the greater per
cent of our readers are living in apartments and homes just
big enough conveniently to care for the family during health,
and while it would be pleasant and convenient to have a spare
room or an attic chamber that could be used in case of illness,
it is the exception rather than the rule that the families to
whom sickness comes have these extra apartments. When a
contagious or an infectious disease comes to the family, it is
of great importance that the sick child be isolated, preferably
on another floor, from that used by the immediate family.</p>

<p>Those living in homes, more than likely can fix up a room
on the attic floor for the isolation, and those living in apartments
may put the sick child in one end of the apartment, while
they inhabit the other end. One family under my observation
not long ago had a child stricken with the measles. In the same
apartment there lived a puny baby not quite two years old.
Coming as it did in February, the mother of the child was
apprehensive, fearing that measles would leave a severe bronchitis
which might mean the death of the already too-delicate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
baby. She was instructed to move the baby's bed to the sun
parlor in the front of the flat, while the boy with the measles
was put in the parents' room in the rear end of the flat. A
sheet was suspended in the middle of the hall leading from the
living-room to the bedrooms. Door knobs were disinfected
daily, a caretaker was put in charge of the measles patient, the
mother very frequently was compelled to go back and administer
a treatment, but each time she donned a large apron and
completely covered her hair with a towel, she administered
the treatment, took off her wrappings, thoroughly washed
her face and hands&mdash;disinfected them&mdash;and returned to her
baby in the front part of the house.</p>

<p>At night this mother slept on the floor on springs and mattress
in the living-room, and to that home the measles came and
departed, and the baby did not get them at all, so perfect was
the isolation, so vigilant the disinfection, and so scrupulous the
care to prevent contamination. So you see from this one
instance that it is altogether possible to make isolation complete
even on the same floor. But, mind you, the dishes that the lad
ate from were all kept in his room. Food was brought to the
sheet and there the caretaker held her dishes while the cook
poured or lifted the food from her clean dishes to the dishes
the caretaker brought from the sick room.</p>

<p>Whether the sick room is in the attic or whether it be the
rear end of an apartment, if the principles of contagion and
disinfection are understood I believe it is perfectly possible
to isolate even scarlet fever without danger to the other members
of the family.</p>

<h4>NECESSARY FURNISHINGS</h4>

<p>For slight indispositions and trifling disorders, it is not necessary
to strip the room of its adornment, but it is well to clear
off the dresser tops, protect them well with many thicknesses
of newspapers covered over by a folded sheet so that alcohol,
witch-hazel and other necessaries will not injure the mahogany
or oak-top dresser. Whenever the children are sick, rob the
room of anything that is going to be in your way. In instances
of infectious or contagious diseases, take down all silk or wool<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
hangings, replace them by washable curtains or inexpensive
ones that can be burned if necessary, and remove valuable
paintings and other bric-a-brac that later fumigation will harm
or that may gather the dust during the days of illness.</p>

<p>Just as it is necessary for the man who mines the coal to wear
suitable garments, and for the woman who does the scrubbing
to dress accordingly, and for the nurse who cares for the case
to wear washable clothes&mdash;so it is necessary to dress the
sick room in garments that are suitable, convenient, and capable
of being thoroughly disinfected, fumigated, or even burned
if the occasion demands. Hence, expensive rugs should be
replaced by rag carpets or no rug at all, while unnecessary
articles and garments should be removed from closets, etc.</p>

<p>Remembering that the little fellow is to remain in this room
for possibly two weeks or maybe six weeks, let us put up
some bright-colored pictures that he will enjoy, bring in some
books and magazines by which he may be entertained, secure
a few simple toys that will not tax the brain, but serve as a
help to pass away the long hours. There are many paper
games that may be had, such as transfer pictures, picture puzzles,
kindergarten papers, drawing pictures, as well as toys that
may be put together to fashion new articles. A whole lot of
fun can be gotten out of a bunch of burrs that can be stuck
together to make men, animals, houses, etc. Scissors and
pictures are entertaining as well as paper dolls with their wardrobes.
Rubber balloons, or a target gun for the boy of six
will be a great source of delight to him; as will a doll with a
trunk full of clothes for the little girl during her convalescent
days. A tactful nurse and a resourceful mother will think of
all the rest that we have not mentioned&mdash;which will amuse,
entertain and keep happy our convalescent children, help them
to forget that they are "shut ins."</p>

<h4>THE NURSERY REFRIGERATOR</h4>

<p>It is wise in instances of the more severe childhood troubles,
such as infectious and contagious diseases, to keep as many
things in the sick room as possible, and so we remind our
reader of the home-made ice box, described elsewhere in this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
book, in which may be kept the fruit juices and the fruits, as
well as the milk and the buttermilk. Many medicines, particularly
the oily medicines, should be kept in this home-made ice
box and five cents worth of ice a day will not only make things
taste better, especially during the warm months, but will protect
the other members of the family, for the family ice box
is a big central station which must be protected against infections
and carriers of disease.</p>

<p>In connection with the ice box, we are reminded that it
would be a great convenience to have a simple contrivance
for heating bouillon, milk, or making a piece of toast, which
can be readily done with an electric heater, an alcohol stove,
or a small apparatus fitting over the gas jet.</p>

<h4>SICK ROOM DISINFECTANTS</h4>

<p>The most important thing which we are going to mention
in this division of the chapter is the disinfection of the door
knobs. According to the directions on the poison bottle, place
an antiseptic tablet into a small amount of water which will
make a solution of 1 to 1000 of bichlorid of mercury, and several
times a day disinfect the door knobs, particularly in the
sick end of the house&mdash;thoroughly washing and adequately
rubbing with a towel moistened in this solution.</p>

<p>All stools and urine from the sick one will receive attention
as directed by the physician. The stools from a typhoid
patient should stand for one-half hour in a chamber covered
with a layer of lime.</p>

<p>It is not at all necessary to have vessels containing disinfectant
substances standing about the room and in the closet. In
a room adjoining should be kept all of the dishes used by the
sick patient, his tray, half a dozen napkins, knife, fork, spoon,
serving dishes, drinking glass, pitcher, etc. All bedding and
all linen used by the sick member should be allowed to stand
in a solution of disinfectant for several hours when they may
be wrung out of the solution, dropped into a bucket and carried
to the laundry without any danger to other members of the
family.</p>

<p>The nurse is not allowed to leave this room in the garments<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
that are worn while caring for the sick. She should have her
meals in an adjoining room which is also under strict isolation.</p>

<h4>THE MEDICINE CHEST</h4>

<p>The sick room medicine chest should be so placed on the
wall that it is outside the reach of the smaller members of the
family, for in it should be placed poisons for external use that
are capable of producing death if taken internally. Bottles
that hold these poisons&mdash;such as bichlorid of mercury, lysol,
carbolic acid, laudanum, paregoric, belladonna, etc.&mdash;should
be so different from the other bottles in the medicine chest
that if one should reach for them with his eyes shut or in the
dark he would at once recognize that he had hold of a poison
bottle. This is absolutely necessary. It usually means a bit
of extra expense, but when we realize what tragedies may be
avoided by such slight expense, it must not be considered.</p>

<p>Bottles may be procured that have been molded with points
of glass projecting from the outside which make them rough to
the touch, or they may be covered with a wire mesh or with a
wicker covering which may easily be told from the other bottles
in the case.</p>

<p>One woman lost her life because the nurse placed two ounces
of carbolic acid in the enema instead of two ounces of saline
solution. Saline solution is nothing but salt and water, while
carbolic acid cost the woman her life, simply because the carbolic
acid was not placed in a specialized poison bottle and the
attendant could not read the label in the dark.</p>

<p>Under no circumstances keep from one year to another the
remnants of unused medicine of a former sickness, for medicines
do not keep well and often lose their strength if kept
longer than the physician intended.</p>

<p>In this medicine chest should be found the following articles:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em;">
A glass graduate marked with fluid drachms (1 teaspoon), and fluid ounces (8 teaspoons).<br />
A medicine dropper.<br />
Absorbent cotton.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>Boric acid.<br />
Camphorated oil.<br />
Castor oil.<br />
Aromatic spirits of ammonia.<br />
Alcohol.<br />
Olive oil.<br />
Epsom salts.<br />
Soda-mint tablets.<br />
Vaseline.<br />
Zinc ointment, together with other medicines the physician orders.<br />
Ice bag, hot-water bottle and oiled silk.<br />
</p>

<p>Besides these articles, in the nursery&mdash;in readiness for emergencies
and accidents&mdash;should be found the following:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em;">
Gauze bandages of various sizes.<br />
Sterile gauze.<br />
Boric acid crystals and powder.<br />
Mustard.<br />
A pocket case of instruments containing scissors, knife, dressing forceps, etc.<br />
Syrup of ipecac.<br />
Glycerin.<br />
Tincture of iodine.<br />
Package of ordinary baking soda.<br />
Peroxid of hydrogen.<br />
Absorbent cotton.<br />
Needle and thread.<br />
Lime water.<br />
</p>

<h4>PATENT MEDICINES</h4>

<p>Aside from the giving of castor oil and the application of
vaseline to the nose, or of applying boracic acid to the eyes,
no medicine should be administered to the baby without competent
medical advice. There are numerous widely advertised
nostrums frequently sold as soothing syrups to be used during
the teething or during attacks of diarrhea, or cough spasms,
croup, or worms, that contain dangerous drugs and should not<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
be given to children. Many well-meaning but ignorant mothers
are slowly but surely laying the foundations for serious
nervous disorders and are often making veritable dope fiends
out of their children. Patent medicines are dangerous things
in the hands of the people; if we are going to give medicines
to our little babies let us at least know what we are giving.
Let some conscientious, scientific physician examine the baby
and prescribe for its needs.</p>

<p>If urged to use a patent medicine, examine the label carefully,
for the Federal Food and Drug Act requires the manufacturer
of patent medicines to print plainly on the label of the
bottle the name and amount of certain dangerous drugs which
it may contain.</p>

<p>The drugs mentioned in this drug act and which are often
used in patent medicine nostrums are, chloral hydrate, cocaine,
heroin, chloroform, alpha or beta eucaine, opium, morphin,
alcohol, cannabis indica, or any derivative or preparation of
any such substance contained therein.</p>

<p>There are many other drugs sold on the market containing
syrups or flavoring materials which may do harm&mdash;which may
upset the baby's digestion.</p>

<p>Mothers avoid patent medicines. Consult your physician.
Never give a baby any sort of medicine to induce sleep. Unless
babies are sick or spoiled or hungry, they will go to sleep of
themselves, and even in the days of a high fever a wet-sheet
pack seldom ever fails to put the baby to sleep and can do no
harm if properly given.</p>

<p>This may be as good a place as any to mention the dosage
of castor oil which is as follows:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 2em;">
Up to three months, &frac12; teaspoon.<br />
From three to six months, 1 teaspoon.<br />
From six to nine months, 1&frac12; teaspoons.<br />
From nine to twelve months, 1 dessert spoon (2 teaspoons).<br />
From twelve months on, 1 to 2 tablespoons.<br />
</p>

<h4>AFTER THE SICKNESS IS OVER</h4>

<p>The physician will direct when the disinfectant bath is to be
given to the patient previous to his liberation from isolation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
The different diseases demand different treatment, but, on the
whole, it is about as follows:</p>

<p>The day before the boy is to be allowed to go out among
the family once more he receives a soap wash, clean sheet and
bedding on the bed, and puts on clean garments. The following
morning, his head thoroughly shampooed, his nails manicured,
a second soap wash is given followed by a weak bichlorid bath
(1 to 10,000 solution) which is followed by an alcohol rub. He
is then allowed to go out of the sick room which is now to be
thoroughly disinfected and fumigated.</p>

<p>After the illness is over, the sick room and the adjoining
closets and ante rooms must be thoroughly disinfected or fumigated.
If you are located in a city, the health authorities will
do this after an infectious or contagious disease. Away from
such conveniences, use the following method:</p>

<p>Place two ounces of crystals of permanganate of potash in a
pan and have a pint bottle of formalin near by. Everything
in the room is now exposed, dresser drawers are opened, all
bedding, all garments&mdash;in fact everything that is in the room&mdash;is
put in such a position as to be readily exposed to the
fumes which are to follow. A line should be stretched across
the room over which are thrown the bedding, garments, etc. The
cracks of the windows and doors, except the one door of exit,
are now sealed up with paper which has been dipped in green
soap, and having the paper strips and pan of green soap ready
just outside the exit door, the formalin is now poured over the
permanganate crystals. Fumes will immediately arise and permeate
every corner, crack and crevice of the sick room. Now
quickly make your exit, close the door and seal up key hole
and cracks and space under the door with paper dipped in
green soap. Leave the room for six hours. After this with
a well-moistened cloth to the nose, rush in and throw the windows
open, hurry out and allow the room to air from twelve to
twenty-four hours, after which wash woodwork and painted
walls or take paper off and repaper walls; recalcimine ceilings
and closets; scrub closet shelves and dresser drawers, bedsteads,
and other furniture thoroughly. If the mattress is old throw it
away, but if not, sun it for several days following the fumigation.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVII</h2>
<h2>DIGESTIVE DISORDERS</h2>
</div>

<p>In this chapter we will consider the diseases which commonly
occur during infancy and early childhood relative to digestion
and the alimentary tract. Irregularity of feeding, feeding
between meals, feeding too much at any given time, as well
as feeding the wrong kind of food may cause stomach disturbances
and intestinal troubles.</p>

<h4>VOMITING</h4>

<p>In a previous chapter, "<a href="#CHAPTER_XIX">The Feeding Problem</a>," a common
stomach disturbance, vomiting, was gone into quite thoroughly,
and in passing to other disorders, we wish to remind the mother
that vomiting should always be taken seriously. The interval
between meals should usually be lengthened, the time spent in
feeding shortened, and it is often necessary to withhold all milk
and food of any kind for twelve or eighteen hours, giving only
boiled, unsweetened water. Vomiting frequently ushers in some
acute disease, and in remote cases, when it is very persistent,
it may indicate inflammation of the brain. Complete rest is
essential, trotting on the knee, suddenly changing the baby's
position, or other quick movements must all be avoided. A
physician should see the sick one and determine the cause of the
trouble.</p>

<h4>COLIC</h4>

<p>Cases of ordinary colic are usually relieved by heat to the
abdomen and feet, drinking hot water in which there has
been dissolved a pinch of ordinary baking soda, or a portion
of a soda mint tablet, or by the use of the photophore, as previously
described. The treatment of such ordinary colic need<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
not be given further consideration here because it has been
described at length in a former chapter; but we do call the
attention of the mother to a more serious form of recurring
colic which so often accompanies chronic intestinal indigestion,
marasmus, and malnutrition.</p>

<p>In most instances the food is radically at fault and should
be reduced to a mixture which can more readily be digested
and assimilated by the child. Often whey mixtures, peptonized
foods, or buttermilk may be indicated. The weight of
the baby, the age of the baby, and the color of the stools,
must all be taken into account in the preparation of this
easily digested food. Weak mixtures should be given at first
and then gradually and carefully the quality may be strengthened
until the normal formula is again used for the baby.</p>

<p>Injections into the bowel of water, to which has been added
one level teaspoon of soda to the pint, will often give relief in
this form of colic.</p>

<h4>CHRONIC INDIGESTION</h4>

<p>While this condition may occur at any time during babyhood
days, it often makes its appearance during the last half
of the first year and up to the fifth year. It is accompanied
by mucus in the stools, chronic flatulence, constipation or
diarrhea, or the alternating of the two, restlessness at night,
distention of the abdomen ("pot bellied") accompanied by pain,
a coated tongue with a fetid breath, and loss of appetite. It
is a pitiable picture&mdash;the weight is usually reduced and the
child gives the appearance of being decidedly undernourished.
This condition is usually occasioned by errors in diet, whether
it be over-feeding or feeding of the wrong element of food,
and, since the diet is usually responsible for the condition, in
the line of treatment diet is a prime factor.</p>

<p>All fats must be taken from the food, sugars should be
avoided, and the amount of starchy foods, such as flour, potatoes
and bread, should be greatly reduced. Buttermilk, skimmed
milk, eggs, green vegetables, and fruit juices should be given.
In the older child, if grains are used, they should be well
toasted or baked.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span></p>

<h4>JAUNDICE</h4>

<p>It is altogether common and physiological for the newborn
baby to pass through a few days of yellow skin which usually
clears up in the second or third week, but it should not recur.
Occasionally this yellow tint deepens, the whites of the eyes
are yellow, the urine passed leaves a yellow stain on the diaper,
while passages from the bowels are white or clay colored. If
the child shows symptoms of ill health other than the yellow
tint, it should receive medical attention. Older children troubled
with jaundice should receive the following treatment: The
photophore as described elsewhere should be applied to the
liver and abdomen (the liver is on the right side), and this
should be followed by the application of what is known as a
heating compress, consisting of three layers&mdash;a cloth wrung
from cold water, a mackintosh, and then two thicknesses of
blanket flannel&mdash;which are all applied when the skin has been
made red by the application of heat. (If the photophore is
unavailable, a hot-water bottle may be applied.) The flannel
is pinned snugly on the outside as the wet cloth goes next to
the skin with the mackintosh between. This should remain on
the abdomen for three or four hours, after which the hot application
is again made to the liver and abdomen. The administration
of broken doses of calomel is sometimes indicated in
obstinate cases in connection with these applications of heat
to the liver. Hot milk or mineral water may be taken with
dry toast. In a day or two the color should clear up, the stools
should be normal again, and the treatment may be discontinued.</p>

<h4>WORMS</h4>

<p>Irritation about the rectum which cannot be otherwise
explained is usually suggestive of pinworms. These seatworms
or pinworms are very much like little pieces of cotton thread&mdash;one-fourth
of an inch in length. They grow and thrive in the
lower part of the large bowel. Simple and effective treatment is
as follows:</p>

<p>It is well to bathe the parts about the rectum after each
bowel movement and often two or three times a day with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
weak antiseptic solution. Itching may be controlled by the
application of a disinfectant ointment, or the local applications
of ice may serve the same purpose. After a thorough
cleansing of the colon by an injection of lukewarm water containing
a teaspoon of borax to the pint in order to remove
the mucus, Doctor Holt suggests that after the discharge of
this borated enema, infusions of quassia are very helpful (See
<a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a>).</p>

<p>Children suffering from roundworms experience a loss of
appetite, varying temperature from above normal to subnormal,
with colicky pains in the abdomen on coming to the table and
beginning to eat. They are pale and listless, or nervous and
irritable.</p>

<p>Roundworms very much resemble earthworms in shape and
color. While their home is in the small intestines they often
travel to other parts of the body. They have sometimes
crawled into the stomach and have been vomited. The only
definite symptom of worms is to find the eggs or the worms
themselves in the stool. No worm medicine should ever be
given by the mouth without being prescribed by a physician.
Cases are on record where well-meaning mothers have killed
their children by giving an over dose of worm medicine.</p>

<p>Tapeworms sometimes trouble children; their segments are
found in the stool, and look like small pieces of tape line. The
segments are flat and thin, one-fourth inch to one-half inch in
width and three-fourths to one inch in length. They are joined
together and often their number is so great the worm is many
feet in length. The segments grow smaller and smaller as
they approach the neck, the head of the worm being a mere
point. As the worm is passing from the child it should never
be pulled, as the head is easily broken off, and, on remaining
in the bowel, it will grow to a full-sized worm.</p>

<p>Worms come from the eating of half-cooked meats; they
enter the stomach as eggs or tiny worms, and pass out into the
small intestines, where they begin to grow. They are a common
parasite in the human family and should be suspected in
all instances where digestive symptoms are masked or do not
yield to treatment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span></p>

<h4>HOOKWORM DISEASE</h4>

<p>This disease, once seen only in the southern part of the
United States, is leaving its former domains as the migrating
population is distributing it more or less widely everywhere.
Sandy soil and country districts are infected by a tiny worm
which thrives in polluted soil and enters the body through the
skin of the feet. It also gets into the body through the drinking
water or from the eating of uncooked vegetables, such as are
used in salads.</p>

<p>The disease is manifested by "sallow skin, paleness, headache,
swollen abdomen and sores on the legs." Little swollen
places where the worm enters the skin may be seen on the
flesh. The condition yields readily to treatment. If a child
is discovered scratching his feet (especially in the southern
part of this country), he should be taken at once to a physician.</p>

<h4>DISORDERED STOMACH</h4>

<p>At the first symptom of a disordered stomach take all food
from the baby and give him rice water prepared by throwing
a cupful of well-washed rice into a kettle of boiling water and
allowing it to continue to boil for a couple of hours. The
water which is strained off is rice water, ready for use after
it is cooled. This may be given to the child at the meal hour
in the place of his regular food. It should be kept in a glass-covered
jar in the ice box. A dose of castor oil, according to
the age, should be administered before the feed. The bowels
should be washed out and boiled water given freely between
the meals of rice water. For a day or two (twenty-four to
forty-eight hours), the child should be fed only this rice water,
or until the temperature returns to normal and he appears very
hungry, at which time milk, which has been boiled for five
minutes, may be added to the rice water, first in one-half ounce
quantities and gradually increased. Each day a little more
milk is added until baby is taking his regular food again.</p>

<p>Many a death and many acute attacks of summer complaint
are avoided by the quick use of castor oil, and by withholding
food and stopping the use of milk as soon as the child becomes
ill.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span></p>

<h4>STOMATITIS OR THRUSH</h4>

<p>Thrush is evidenced by fretfulness or crying on attempting
to nurse. On examination of the mouth it is found to be hot
and very tender and covered with little white specks which,
if looked at under the microscope, appear to be a fungus
growth. If scratched off, the mucous membrane bleeds easily.
Thrush often occurs during a fever or in connection with other
diseases, and is often due to neglect and lack of cleanliness
about the bottles, nipples, etc. Taken in time it is quickly
cured. An immediate dose of castor oil or milk of magnesia
is indicated, and the use of a mouth wash which will be prescribed
by the physician. If neglected, it may become ulcerous
or gangrenous, which is a very serious condition. Everything
pertaining to the feeding, as well as the child's toys, hands,
etc., must be kept scrupulously clean.</p>

<h4>CONSTIPATION</h4>

<p>In the chapter, "<a href="#CHAPTER_XIX">The Feeding Problem</a>," constipation in
bottle-fed babies was discussed. The bowels should move at
least once in twenty-four hours. The passages are frequently
very hard and leave the body only after a very great effort of
straining. This constipation, often continuing until late childhood,
should be corrected in the following manner:</p>

<p>In early infancy&mdash;as early as the fourth month&mdash;prune
juice may be given as directed elsewhere, while in later
months prune pulp or fig pulp, which has been carefully rubbed
through a fine-mesh colander, may be given at meal time. By
the time the baby is eleven or twelve months old, strained apple
sauce may be given.</p>

<p>We deplore the use of the water enema as a regular daily
procedure; in its place we suggest the use of the enema of oil
or the introduction into the rectum of a gluten suppository or
in obstinate cases a glycerine suppository. Abdominal massage
should be daily administered. With a well-oiled hand,
begin on the right abdomen and proceed upward to the lower
border of the right ribs and across to the left side and down.
This should be repeated many times at a regular hour each
day. The mother should select an hour for the bowels to move,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
preferably after the forenoon feeding, and if the child is too
small to sit upon the toilet chair, a gluten suppository may be
placed into the rectum before the forenoon feed and some time
during the middle of the day the bowel movement will be
found in the napkin.</p>

<p>For the older child, before a certain meal each day, a well-vaselined
piece of cotton may be inserted in the rectum; this
often produces a bowel movement immediately after the meal.
Laxative foods, such as bran, stewed figs, stewed prunes, or a
raw apple, should be used faithfully&mdash;as repeated medication
never corrects the difficulty, but usually prolongs it.</p>

<p>To immediately flush out the bowel, a soapsuds enema or a
plain water enema may be allowed to flow into the lower colon,
or a glycerine suppository inserted into the rectum will quickly
bring a bowel movement. These methods are only of temporary
value; a regular habit should be formed, if possible, to
bring about a natural, normal bowel movement. When necessary
to resort to drugs&mdash;such remedies as cascara sagrada,
milk of magnesia, or syrup of rhubarb, are satisfactory, as
well as our old stand-by&mdash;castor oil. Regular habits must be
insisted upon, and if the mother pays attention to regularity
at stool in early childhood very little trouble will be met later
on in adolescence and adult life.</p>

<p>Chronic constipation often produces abnormal conditions
about the rectum such as fissures, hemorrhoids, or prolapse,
which may be of serious import.</p>

<h4>DIARRHEA</h4>

<p>Diarrhea is a symptom of an acute illness, or it may be associated
with a chronic condition such as chronic intestinal indigestion,
tuberculosis of the bowel, or may occur alternately with
constipation in colitis. It is the most dangerous of all symptoms
that babies develop, and in spite of all the instruction
given to mothers at the present time, in spite of all the welfare
stations in large cities, and in spite of all the efforts put
forth by the commissioner of health, with his corps of visiting
nurses&mdash;even yet, more babies die of diarrhea each summer
than from any other single cause.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span></p>

<p>There are usually just two reasons for diarrhea&mdash;uncleanliness
and bad milk. During the hot summer days flies multiply
greatly and all manner of bacteria and germs grow in warm,
moist, shadowy places, so that usually before the milk leaves
the dairy farm it is seriously contaminated with disease-producing
germs. If the milk is not kept at a temperature of 35 or
40 F. (which is just above the freezing point), these bacteria,
particularly the manure germ, grow at such a rate that by the
time the milk gets to the infant it is teeming with bacteria, and
diarrhea is the sure result.</p>

<p>Another form of diarrhea is cholera infantum, where the
stools soon become watery and colorless. The vomiting is
almost incessant and there is high fever. Fortunately it is a
rare disease, but when once seen it is never forgotten. One
beautiful baby weighing nearly thirty pounds was reduced to
sixteen within forty-eight hours, and when death came he could
hardly be recognized because of the wasting from this most
dreaded of infant diseases.</p>

<p>Another form of diarrhea is seen in an acute inflammatory
condition of the intestine itself. The stools contain more or
less mucus and blood. The bowel movements, which are very
frequent, are accompanied by a great deal of pain and straining.
This form is often seen in the more severe types of summer
dysentery. We wish to impress upon the reader's mind
that these diarrheas may all be avoided if the baby's food is
clean and free from germs, if the apple or pear is not only
washed, but thoroughly scrubbed before paring during the
summer months. If all the bottles, nipples, water, toys, etc.,
are adequately clean, no summer diarrhea, no dysentery, no other
infection due to dirt, will attack the baby. Of paramount
importance is the pasteurization of milk during the summer
months, as mentioned elsewhere.</p>

<h4>TREATMENT OF DIARRHEA</h4>

<p>Simple diarrhea in the older child of two or three years
is treated as follows: Take away all solid foods. Give a big
<ins class="typo" title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'does'">dose</ins> of castor oil, thoroughly wash out the bowel by warm
water containing a level teaspoon of salt and a level teaspoon<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
of baking soda to the pint, and put the child to bed in
a quiet room. Boil all milk for ten minutes and thicken it
with flour that has been browned in the oven; feed this to
the child at five-hour intervals. After each bowel movement,
no matter how often they come, the colon should be washed
out with the salt and soda enema as before mentioned.</p>

<p>Bear in mind that the child is losing liquids, and so, after
the bowels have moved, boiled water should be given by
mouth, or a cupful of water can often be retained if it is introduced
into the rectum slowly under very low pressure. Twenty-four
or forty hours should clear up a case of simple diarrhea,
and on returning to food it should be dry toast and boiled
milk. For the younger baby, withhold all milk and give barley
water or rice water for the first twenty-four hours, returning
to milk very gradually and slowly.</p>

<p>For the more severe types, such as the dysentery containing
mucus and blood, everything that has been done for the simple
diarrhea should be done; the baby should be kept very quiet,
while castor oil should be promptly administered. Food is
withheld and the bowels are carefully irrigated after each
movement with the salt and soda solutions. After the bowels
have moved from the castor oil, then bismuth subnitrate, which
has been dissolved in two ounces of water, should be given&mdash;one
or two teaspoons every three hours. This will naturally
turn the bowel movements dark.</p>

<p>Under no circumstances should any other medicines be given
without the physician's knowledge, as it is at such times as
this that many "would-be friends" advise laudanum, paregoric,
and other opiates. The skin must be kept warm, and
fluids must replace those that have been carried off in the
many stools. Water may be given by an enema, by water
drinking, and in such rare cases as cholera infantum, when
water cannot be retained on the stomach, it often becomes necessary
to inject it under the skin (hypodermoclysis) so that it
may go at once to the wasted tissues and perhaps save the
baby's life.</p>

<p>Give the baby ten days or two weeks to return to normal
condition, and under no circumstances hurry the feeding of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
milk, as a second attack may occur much more readily than
the first; may more profoundly overcome the baby and result
in death.</p>

<h4>RUPTURE</h4>

<p>A protrusion of a loop or portion of intestine through a
weakened abdominal muscle&mdash;which grows larger when baby
cries and smaller when he is lying down in a relaxed condition&mdash;is
known as rupture or hernia, and is of common occurrence
in infancy. It is often seen at the navel and sometimes
in the groin as early as the second week.</p>

<p>Hernia is always dangerous and should never be neglected.
The physician will protect the navel by a special support with
adhesive plaster which is carefully renewed twice a week, and
if worn for several months usually entirely corrects the condition.
A comfortable truss made from skeins of white yarn
will amply protect a groin hernia. The condition should
always be taken seriously and receive immediate treatment.</p>

<h4>PROLAPSE OF THE BOWEL</h4>

<p>Occasionally, as the result of severe straining in constipation,
the rectum protrudes sometimes one-half inch, and in
rare instances two or three inches. The placing of a young
child upon a toilet chair and insisting upon severe straining
sometimes results in such a protrusion of the rectum. This
may be avoided by the application of vaseline to the rectum or
by the use of the gluten or glycerine suppositories which cause
the hardened masses to make their way out easily. Someone
has suggested that if the buttocks are supported by a board
placed over the toilet seat with a two-inch opening so that
severe straining of the rectal muscles is impossible, the prolapse
of the rectum will not recur.</p>

<p>The moment the mother observes the slightest protrusion
of the rectum she should quickly put it back and have the child
lie down and move the bowel in the diaper. Very severe cases
require a physician's attention, but if prompt and quick measures
are taken on the first appearance it may be quickly corrected
and serious consequences be avoided.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span></p>

<p>In this connection we might mention a condition which sometimes
babies are born with&mdash;the absence of the rectal opening.
If the baby's bowels do not move for the first two days, surgical
interference is more than likely necessary. Often the
external opening alone is missing. Sometimes there is a complete
closure or atresia of the lower part of the colon.</p>

<h4>BLEEDING FROM THE NAVEL</h4>

<p>There should be no hemorrhage from the umbilical stump
after it has been properly tied, but occasionally a bit of blood
is found upon the dressing and a second tying of the cord
stump is necessary. The cord drops off in eight or ten days,
and the umbilicus that is left may be moist or it may bleed
slightly; if such is the case, great care should be exercised in
bathing this ulcer that has been left behind. It simply should be
touched with alcohol, a bit of boric acid powder applied, and a
small piece of sterile gauze be placed over it. In the course of
two or three days it will entirely heal. Care should always be
exercised in washing the umbilicus. Extensive hemorrhage
from this portion of the body is rare, but it does happen occasionally
and is a severe condition which demands surgical attention.</p>

<p>If the umbilicus remains moist and foul smelling, general
blood poisoning of the infant may easily follow. Thorough
dusting with boric acid powder, with possibly a little oxide of
zinc, will usually effect a cure promptly, but should the condition
continue, which it does only in rare instances, the doctor
may have to cauterize it.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII</h2>
<h2>CONTAGIOUS DISEASES</h2>
</div>

<p>Never under any circumstances knowingly expose a child
to any of the so-called "childhood diseases." The old
method of "have the child get them as quickly as possible and
get over them," has laid the foundation for many chronic disorders
later in life. For instance, eye troubles and running
ears are often the sequelae of measles; chronic coughs, tuberculosis
and bronchitis frequently follow in the wake of whooping
cough; heart disorders follow diphtheria, while kidney disease
often follows in the course of scarlet fever.</p>

<h4>CATCHING DISEASE</h4>

<p>Under all circumstances keep the children away from these
dangerous childhood diseases. When a contagious disease
breaks out in a school and the little fellow has, along with the
other pupils, been exposed to it, begin at once systematically
to keep the nose and throat very clean with such well-known
sprays as the champhor-menthol-albolene spray, which should
be used in the nose morning, noon, and night. Throat gargles,
such as listerine, or equal parts of alcohol and water, help to
keep the throat in condition to resist the microbic invasion.</p>

<p>During this anxious time of patient waiting the bowels should
move every day and the food should be cut down at least a
third. In other words, moderate eating and a clean bowel
tract go a long way toward keeping a child well and preparing
him for an attack of disease. The skin at this time should
be kept well bathed and free from the accumulated skin secretions
which clog up the sweat glands and otherwise lower the
vitality.</p>

<p>Stuffy, close rooms, where the ventilation is poor, not only<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
harbor disease germs, but also lower the vitality of the child.
Never take your child into a household where there is any form
of sickness, for it may turn out to be a contagious disease&mdash;no
matter how it began, it must be remembered that many
contagious diseases, in their earlier stages, much resemble a
simple cold.</p>

<p>Measles come on rather gradually, and one might suspect
that the child was simply suffering from a severe cold in the
head.</p>

<p>Scarlet fever usually begins with a sore throat, while chickenpox
has very few initial symptoms; usually the first thing
noted is the rash itself. Diphtheria begins with a sore throat,
while whooping cough begins very insidiously.</p>

<p>The most important thing is to keep children away from
people who are sick, and if a contagious or infectious disease
is prevalent in the neighborhood discourage the mingling of
the children in hot, illy ventilated rooms. Put a stop to "parties"
and all similar gatherings. Let the little folks have
good books, plenty of toys, in a well-ventilated room, and the
more they keep to themselves at this particular time the better
they are off.</p>

<h4>THE SPREAD OF CONTAGION</h4>

<p>It is possible to "stamp out" any known disease if only
proper cooperation takes place and certain sanitary regulations
are maintained. It is within the memory of most of our readers
when yellow fever was put to flight and the cause of malaria
discovered. We learned to screen our camps and no longer
did our soldiers contract the fever; while the simple covering
of stagnant pools with oil, together with proper screenage,
stopped the ravages of malaria.</p>

<p>Likewise, many of the woeful tragedies of infant summer
diarrhea and dysenteries have been tracked to the so-called
"innocent house fly." We have all learned&mdash;only recently&mdash;that
if we move the manure pile once in seven days the hatching
of the maggots may be prevented, and so millions, yes
trillions, of these carriers of disease may never be born.</p>

<p>If there is one sweet morsel above another for this fly pest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
it is tubercular sputum or feces, and from these feasts they
go directly to walk over baby's hands, crawl over his cheek,
and wash their feet in his milk. Proper screenage will prevent
such contamination of food, such opportunities for carrying
disease.</p>

<p>Sunshine, hot water, soap, and fresh air, are the best ordinary
every-day disinfectants. It is possible so to conduct the
treatment of a contagious or infectious disease that no other
member of the family may contract it. A few simple but very
important hints are:</p>

<p>1. Door knobs are one of the very greatest avenues of contagion&mdash;disinfect
them.</p>

<p>2. Cleanse the hands both before and after attending to the
sick; first, scrub with stiff brush, soap and water, then dip in
alcohol.</p>

<p>3. An epidemic of sore eyes may be stopped by absolute
"hand disinfection" and using separate towels.</p>

<p>4. Do not go visiting when you have a "common cold."</p>

<p>5. Kissing is one of the best ways of spreading many diseases.</p>

<p>6. In cases of contagious and infectious diseases completely
cover all excretions from the body with lime.</p>

<p>7. Country homes would be as healthy as city homes if the
privies and stables were screened.</p>

<p>8. In the country, the well water should be boiled; one
infected well may be the cause of the death of a score of
beautiful children.</p>

<h4>INCUBATION PERIODS</h4>

<p>The incubation period of scarlet fever is from one to seven
days.</p>

<p style=" margin-left: 2em; ">
Measles, ten to twenty days.<br />
Whooping cough, from one to two weeks.<br />
Chicken-pox, fourteen to sixteen days.<br />
German measles, seven to twenty-one days.<br />
Diphtheria, any time from one to twelve days.<br />
Mumps, from one week to three weeks.<br />
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span></p>

<p>Of all the diseases, measles and chicken-pox are probably the
most contagious. In scarlet fever and diphtheria, close contact
is necessary for exposure, while whooping cough can actually
be contracted in the open air, young babies being particularly
susceptible.</p>

<h4>TYPHOID FEVER</h4>

<p>Typhoid fever is a disease of the small intestine. Typhoid
germs accumulate in the little lymph nodes of the small intestines
and that is the reason why we often have so many hemorrhages
from the bowel&mdash;actual ulcerations take place&mdash;and if
an ulcer is situated in the neighborhood of a blood vessel hemorrhage
may result.</p>

<p>Typhoid fever begins rather insidiously with a slight debility
and loss of appetite, but if a temperature record is kept the
fever will be found to rise from one-half to a degree higher
each day. A steady climb in the temperature curve is noted
until the end of the first week, when it remains for a week,
possibly 103 or 104 F. After one week it begins slowly to
decrease and, if all goes well, the early part of the fourth week
usually finds the temperature about normal. It is exceedingly
important that the child be kept in bed during the entire course
of the disease. The bed pan must be used at each bowel movement
or urination.</p>

<p><i>First Week Treatment.</i> During this week the child may feel
quite well, but he should be kept in bed and sustaining treatments
begun&mdash;such as wet-sheet packs and cold frictions to
the skin (during which time there should always be external
heat to the feet). The diet must be full and nourishing, but
all pastries and "knicknacks" should be avoided. Abundance
of fresh fruit that has been well washed before paring, eggs,
pasteurized milk, baked potatoes, and toasted bread may be
taken at regular periods&mdash;with an interval of not less than
five hours between meals.</p>

<p>The bowels should be opened in the beginning of the disease
with a liberal dose of castor oil, after which daily colonic irrigations
should be employed. These enemas should be given
at least once a day, the temperature being about that of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
body, with a smaller terminal enema about five degrees cooler
at the close of each bowel cleansing.</p>

<p><i>Second Week Treatment.</i> The normal temperature at this
time is no longer 98.6, it is 101.5 F. This fever is essential to
the curative and defensive processes of the body; and while
we do not care to have the fever fall below 101.5, at the same
time nothing is to be gained by allowing the fever to go up
much above 102.5 or 103 degrees F. And so, during the second
week, while the disease is at its height, we make frequent use
of the wet-sheet pack, always remembering that the extremities
must be kept warm and never permitting the skin to become
blue or mottled while the cold treatment is being administered.
Since the real disease is localized in the small intestine, we will
now describe a very important treatment for the diseased bowel&mdash;and
one which is also very useful in combating high temperature.</p>

<p><i>The Cooling Enema.</i> The temperature of this enema begins
one degree higher than that of the body (supposing the body
temperature to be 103, the temperature of the enema would
start at 104 F.). This is allowed to flow into the colon and out
again, under low pressure, without disturbing the patient, by
means of a glass tube connection (See <a href="#illus-017">Fig. 15</a>). The temperature
is quickly brought down to 100, then to 98, then to 90,
usually finishing up at 80 or 85 F. The water is allowed to enter
the rectum slowly through a soft rubber catheter (not a hard
rectal point), and as it comes out it will be noted that the water
is very warm, sometimes registering 105, and it is needless to add
that if the water goes in at 80 and comes out at 105 F., much
heat has been taken from the body; and so, of all the treatments
we have to suggest for typhoid fever, the one just mentioned
is possibly the most important. When it is necessary
to keep up this enema for an hour or two, the cool water may
cramp the bowels, but this may be entirely obviated by applying
hot compresses to the abdomen.</p>

<p>Another treatment of great importance in this second week
is the cold abdominal compress. Much fever is occasioned in
the abdomen because it is the seat of disease, and the much
dreaded hemorrhages which often cause the death of the
patient are usually avoided by the use of abdominal compresses&mdash;wrung
out of water at 55 F.&mdash;the temperature of
ordinary well water&mdash;and changed every twenty minutes.</p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span></p>

<p>I recall one mother in my dispensary practice who was so
poor she could not afford a nurse, her only helper being a son
twelve years old. A nurse went to the house twice each day
and taught this lad of twelve years to give his mother the
cooling colonic irrigation; he was also taught to warm up the
abdomen by a hot application and afterwards to apply the cold
compresses. The mother made a good recovery.</p>

<p>During this second week the diet should be sustaining. It
should consist of boiled milk, eggs, fresh fruit and fresh fruit
juices, dextrinized grains (hard toast, toasted corn flakes,
shredded wheat biscuits, etc.). The mouth should be kept
scrupulously clean, for in all the infectious and contagious diseases
there is always the possibility of gangrene in the mouth
if it is neglected.</p>

<p><i>Third Week Treatment.</i> This is the week we look for hemorrhage
from the bowel unless the abdomen has been well
treated during the second week; and even so, the cool compresses
to the abdomen will be continued well into the third
week&mdash;also the daily or semi-daily enema. The skin is kept
in good condition with soap washing and friction baths, and a
fairly liberal diet is maintained. During the whole course of
the disease the skin is never allowed to get blue or mottled,
being quickly restored to the normal red color by the mustard
sheet bath, the short hot-blanket pack, or the dry-blanket pack
with hot-water bottles. Under no circumstances let the child
leave the room or his bed for at least another week.</p>

<h4>MUMPS</h4>

<p>Infants are rarely affected with mumps. It is a disease of
the salivary glands and (as a rule) is usually preceded by pain
between the ear and the angle of the jaw, accompanied in a
short time by swelling and temperature. It is distinctly contagious
even during the incubation period. There is much tenderness
on pressure, and chewing is difficult and may be impossible.
It usually occurs on the face and only one side may be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
affected. The bowels should be kept open, the mouth should
be kept clean, and the side of the face should be protected by
a layer of cotton held in place by bandages.</p>

<p>Hot fomentations may be applied if the pain is severe. The
electric light bulb on an extension cord, that was mentioned
in connection with earache, is very comforting in this condition.</p>

<p>Isolation should be maintained for ten days or two weeks
after all symptoms have disappeared.</p>

<h4>SCARLET FEVER</h4>

<p>Scarlet fever is one of childhood's most dreaded diseases
because of, first, its long quarantine; second, its terrible possibilities
of contagion; and, third, its sequelae.</p>

<p>Absolute quarantine is necessary until ten days after the last
signs of desquamation have disappeared.</p>

<p>This disease is always alarming because of the possibilities
of its sequelae&mdash;the danger of pneumonia, inflammation of
the ears, abscesses of the glands of the neck, and nephritis
(inflammation of the kidneys).</p>

<p>Scarlet fever is highly contagious at any time during its
onset and course. Among the first symptoms of the disease
are sore throat, swollen glands, fever, etc. Vomiting on a
street car or at the movie may spread the disease to more
than one child who might otherwise have escaped. One child
who may have only a very light form of the disease may give
it to another child in the most severe form. Any such group
of classic symptoms&mdash;vomiting, fever, rapid pulse, and sore
throat&mdash;should cause any parent immediately to isolate the
little sufferer for several days&mdash;awaiting the "rash"&mdash;which
usually puts in its appearance after three or four days of
increasing temperature.</p>

<p>This rash has an appearance "all of its own," unlike any
other. Because the fine "meal-like" red points are in such
close proximity, the skin assumes a smooth "lobster red"
color that is never to be forgotten. After three days of increasing
redness, the color begins slowly to fade, and after four
or five days of this fading a peculiar peeling takes place, whose<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
scales vary in size from a small fleck to casts of the whole of
the soles of the feet and the palms of the hands.</p>

<p>During the height of the disease, the throat is very red,
the tonsils are not only inflamed, but covered over with white
patches, the head aches and the tongue possesses a peculiar coating
through which peep the red points of the swollen papillae,
presenting the classic "strawberry tongue" of scarlet fever.</p>

<p>After ten days the fever disappears and the "real sick"
stage of the disease is in the past.</p>

<p>Each morning of the ten previous days a small dose of Epsom
salts is usually administered and the itching, which so often
accompanies the rash, is relieved by carbolized-water sponge
baths.</p>

<p>The nose, throat, and ears receive daily care&mdash;sprays to the
nose and gargles to the throat, as well as special swabbing to
the tonsils.</p>

<p>The physician in charge of the case will note the urinary
findings, guard the heart and kidneys, prevent the spreading of
the scales of desquamation by frequent rubbing of the skin with
oil, and otherwise work for the future well-being of the
patient.</p>

<h4>MEASLES</h4>

<p>Measles, one of the most common diseases of childhood, is
not to be regarded lightly, for very often its sequelae&mdash;running
ears, weak eyes, and bronchial coughs&mdash;may prove very
serious and troublesome. Tuberculosis of the lungs not infrequently
follows in the wake of measles. The early symptoms
of measles are so mild that often the child is out of doors, at
school, or about his usual play, until the second or third day
of the fever. He was supposed merely to be suffering from
a simple "cold in the head."</p>

<p>On the third or fourth day the patient begins heavy sneezing
and wears a stupid expression; and it is then that the
mother ascertains that his temperature is perhaps 101 to 102 F.
He is put to bed and the next day the rash usually appears. The
rash is peculiar to itself, not usually mistaken for anything else,
being a purplish red, slightly elevated, flattened papule, about<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
the size of a split pea. The coughing, which is very annoying,
usually remains until about the seventh or eighth day&mdash;at
which time the fever also disappears.</p>

<p>The bowels must be kept open; a daily bath be given&mdash;in
which has been dissolved a small amount of bicarbonate of
soda (simple baking soda)&mdash;after which an oil rub should
be administered. The nose should be frequently sprayed with
three per cent camphor-menthol-alboline spray, while the throat
is gargled with equal parts of alcohol and water. The feet
should be kept warm by external heat, while the physician in
charge may order additional attention to the chest, such as a
pneumonia jacket, etc.</p>

<p>Care should be taken to guard against "catching cold," for
bronchitis or pneumonia is quite likely to develop in many cases
of measles. The eyes should be protected by goggles and the
room should be darkened; under no circumstances should the
little patient be allowed to read. Carelessness in this respect
may mean weakened eyesight all the rest of his life. Until two
weeks after the rash has disappeared, the little fellow should
be kept by himself, for the desquamation keeps up almost continuously
during this time.</p>

<p>The food during the course of the disease is a liquid and soft
diet. Children should never be allowed to go to a party or
gathering with a cold in the head; the mothers of a group of
small children will never forget the time that one certain
mother allowed her little fellow to attend a party with "simply
a cold in the head." He laughed, talked, and sneezed during
the afternoon and when he went home the rash appeared that
night, while eight of the ten exposed children came down with
measles during the next two weeks.</p>

<h4>CHICKENPOX</h4>

<p>The incubation period of chickenpox is from ten to seventeen
days. It is a mild disease, with a troublesome rash consisting
of widely scattered pimples appearing over the scalp,
face, and body. These pimples soon became vesicles (small
blisters), which in turn quickly become pustular, afterwards
drying up with heavy crust formation. Severe itching which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
attends these pustules may be greatly allayed by either the
daily carbolic-acid-water bath or a baking-soda bath. The itching
must be relieved by proper measures, for if the crust is
removed from the top of the blebs by scratching, a scar usually
results. The bowels should be kept open, the diet should be soft.
Rigidly isolate, for chickenpox is highly contagious.</p>

<h4>SMALLPOX</h4>

<p>This disease occurs oftenest during the cold season. It spares
no one unless vaccinated, attacking children and adults alike.
The early symptoms are: headache, pain in the back, high fever,
vomiting, and general lassitude. In many respects these resemble
the symptoms of the grippe, while on the third day the
eruption appears. The pimples are hard and feel like shot under
the skin. Within a day or two these shotlike pimples have
grown and pushed themselves beyond the skin into little conical
vesicles which soon turn to pus. By the eighth or ninth day
crusts are formed over the vesicle, beginning to fall off about
the fifteenth day.</p>

<p>Patients are quarantined usually eight weeks and when a case
of smallpox in the home breaks out everyone in the family
should be revaccinated. The strictest isolation is important from
the first of the disease.</p>

<p>We will not enter into the treatment of smallpox, for medical
aid is sought at once and usually the patient is removed to
a special isolation hospital.</p>

<h4>VACCINATION</h4>

<p>The history of the change brought about in the Philippines
since vaccination has been introduced is an argument of itself
which ought to convince the most skeptical of the value of
vaccination. By all means, every child in a fair degree of health
should be vaccinated. It is wise to vaccinate babies before the
teething period&mdash;from the third to the sixth month. Babies
with any skin trouble or suffering from malnutrition, but not
living in a smallpox district, should be vaccinated during the
second year. In young babies, under six months, the leg is the
proper place to receive the vaccination.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span></p>

<p>If proper surgical cleanliness is practiced and ample protection
is afforded in after dressing, vaccination need not be a taxing
process. The child suffers from general lassitude&mdash;a little
drowsiness with loss of appetite and a small amount of fever&mdash;but
this passes off in a reasonable length of time, especially if
he is not overfed and his bowels are looked after. On the second
or third day after vaccination a red papule appears which
soon grows larger, and, after five or six days, it becomes filled
with a watery fluid. By the tenth day it has the appearance of
a pustule about the size of a ten-cent piece, surrounded by a
red areola about three inches in diameter. At the end of two
weeks the pustule has dried down to a good crust or scab, in
another week it falls off, leaving a pitted white scar.</p>

<p>If the vaccination does not take, it should be repeated after
an interval of two months.</p>

<h4>DIPHTHERIA</h4>

<p>Diphtheria is a disease much dreaded during childhood and
adolescence. It may attack any age&mdash;even little babies are
susceptible. It begins with a general feeling of heavy, drowsy
lassitude with a sore throat. White spots appear on the tonsils
which may resemble a simple follicular tonsillitis, while in a
short time white patches spread over the throat and tonsils.</p>

<p>It is not at all uncommon for this membrane to attack the
nose, producing a bloody, pustular discharge; and when it does
attack the nose, it is none the less contagious and must be regarded
just as seriously. A physician is called at once, and,
not only to the child, but to the other members of the family,
antitoxin is immediately administered. The disease runs a regular
course and its most dangerous complication is the membrane
which forms in the larynx and threatens to suffocate the child
unless prompt intubation is performed&mdash;the slipping of a silver
tube in the larynx to prevent suffocation and death. The early
use of antitoxin greatly lessens all these serious complications.</p>

<p>Care must be exercised to prevent sudden heart failure; and
this is done by raising the child to an upright position with the
utmost care; while you insist upon him lying quietly upon his
back or his side, long after the disease has left his throat. While<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
the throat or nose is the seat of disease, the toxins from these
most dreaded diphtheritic microbes spread through the lymph
channels and the blood vessels to the heart itself&mdash;so weakening
that organ that it sometimes suddenly fails, or becomes more
or less crippled for life. These serious results are to be prevented
by the science of good nursing and the prompt use of
antitoxin. In these days the "Schick test" may be administered
for the purpose of ascertaining whether one is susceptible to
contracting diphtheria.</p>

<p>A physician is always in charge of diphtheria, and he will
supply directions for the bowels, the diet, and the sprays for the
nose and throat, and the general well-being of the suffering
child. Isolation and quarantine should continue for two weeks,
and in bad cases three weeks, after the membrane has disappeared
from the throat.</p>

<h4>WHOOPING COUGH</h4>

<p>A child suffering from a continuous cough, particularly if it
is accompanied by a whoop or a condition which is so often
seen in children who cough&mdash;not able to stop&mdash;should not be
taken to church, nor to the movies, nor allowed to go to school;
neither should he be allowed to leave his own yard. The average
duration of the disease is usually six weeks. The child
should have an abundance of fresh air, should spend much of
his time out of doors, and while in the house should avoid dust
of every kind; at night he should not be exposed to drafts. Call
the physician early in the case and he may attempt to thwart
the progress of the disease by certain administrations of vaccine
medication.</p>

<p>In very bad cases, where a young child cannot catch his breath
and gets blue in the face&mdash;which, fortunately, is uncommon&mdash;he
should be slapped in the face with a towel wet in cold water;
or, he may be lifted into a tub of warm water, then quickly in
cold water, then back into the warm, etc. Hygienic measures
should prevail, such as keeping the bowels open, the skin clean,
and the use of the usual throat gargles and nasal sprays. Do
not be misguided by the old-time thought that whooping cough
must run its course; for, if medical aid is promptly secured, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
disease may often be cut short and the severe paroxysms greatly
lessened.</p>

<h4>EYE INFECTIONS</h4>

<p>Not long ago while in North Dakota near Canada, we took a
trip one day just over the border to visit several villages of Russian
peasants. We found the boys and girls of nearly the entire
village suffering from trachoma&mdash;a dangerous, infectious disease
of the eyes which spreads alarmingly from one child to
another.</p>

<p>We saw the disease in all of its varying degrees among the
children. Some of them had swollen, reddened lids. A discharge
of pus was coming from the eyes of others, and they
could not look toward a light or the sun. This disease is spread
in a hundred different ways&mdash;through the common use of wash
basins, towels, handkerchiefs, tools, toys, door knobs, gates, etc.,
and that is the reason why these isolated villages of foreign
people who could neither read nor write the English language
were nearly all so sorely afflicted.</p>

<p>The ordinary condition of "catching cold in the eye" ("pink
eye") is just as infectious as the trachoma which we have mentioned,
although it is more of an acute disorder and nothing like
so serious.</p>

<p>In all such cases a physician is to be called immediately, isolate
the patient, and give strict attention to carrying out the
doctor's orders.</p>

<p>Another form of inflammation of the eye which was mentioned
in a previous chapter, is the inflammation of the eye of
the newborn.</p>

<p>In most civilized districts at the present, especially where the
cases are attended by a physician, the eyes of all newborn
babies are treated with either argyrol or silver nitrate. Just as
soon as defective sight is discovered in the child the eyes should
be examined at once and proper glasses fitted. While the glimmer
and shimmer of moving pictures may seriously interfere
with the child's vision, on the other hand, this very thing often
discovers the defect in the eyesight earlier than it would otherwise
be found out.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span></p>

<h4>RUNNING EARS</h4>

<p>Inflammation of the ears was fully covered in our discussion
of adenoids and tonsils, but we would like to add at this time
that under no circumstances should a running ear be regarded
lightly. A chronic mastoiditis (inflammation of the middle ear)
often follows measles, scarlet fever, adenoid infection, and inflammation
of the tonsils. The attention of a specialist should be
called to it and his instructions most carefully carried out; for,
when we have a sudden stopping of the discharge from the ear
with high fever and pain behind the ear, sometimes an operation
is imperative or the child may be lost.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXIX</h2>
<h2>RESPIRATORY DISEASES</h2>
</div>

<p>Next to digestive disturbances, babies suffer more frequently
from respiratory disorders&mdash;colds, bronchitis, and
pneumonia. In fact, during very early infancy, pneumonia
heads the list of infant deaths, only to be displaced a few months
later by that most dreaded summer disease&mdash;diarrhea.</p>

<p>Little tiny babies are so helpless&mdash;they are so dependent upon
their seniors for life itself&mdash;that our responsibility is indeed
great. We should put forth our best endeavor to avoid and prevent
common colds. Among all the common maladies that afflict
the human race "colds" probably head the list; and, in the case
of babies and the younger children, the common colds often go
on into coughs, croup, bronchitis, and even pneumonia.</p>

<h4>WHY BABIES CATCH COLD</h4>

<ol>
<li>Someone has brought the infection to him.</li>
<li>Somebody coughed in his face.</li>
<li>Germ-laden hands have handled the baby.</li>
<li>He has drunk from an "infected" glass.</li>
<li>There was not enough moisture in the air.</li>
<li>Somebody wiped his face with an infected towel.</li>
<li>Baby was allowed to play on the cold floor.</li>
<li>Baby's lowered vitality could not stand the combined strain of overeating and clogged up bowels.</li>
<li>Baby was kissed in the mouth by a "cold-germ" carrier.</li>
<li>Baby was dressed too warmly&mdash;and then taken out.</li>
<li>Somebody carelessly breathed in baby's face.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span></li>
<li>He slept in a stuffy room.</li>
<li>His extremities got chilled.</li>
<li>Baby has adenoids or diseased tonsils.</li>
</ol>

<p>Babies should not be allowed to sit or play on cold, drafty
floors. They may play on mother's bed whose open side is
protected with high-back chairs, or they may play in their own
bed whose raised sides are sheltered by blankets.</p>

<p>It is possible for a mother so to disinfect her hands, and so
garb herself with clean, washable garments, that, although she
may be suffering from an acute cold, she may continue to care
for her baby and the baby need not contract the cold.</p>

<h4>CORYZA&mdash;COLD IN THE HEAD</h4>

<p>This most annoying ailment, a cold in the head, is particularly
hard on babies because the obstruction of the nasal passages not
only makes breathing difficult, but renders nursing well-nigh impossible.</p>

<p>The throat end of the eustachium tube (the ear tube) is found
in the upper and back part of the throat, just behind the nose.
The infection of the cold extends from both the nose and throat
and there results a spreading inflammatory process on through
these ear tubes into the middle ear itself. Now if this tube
swells so much that it entirely closes, as so often happens in
cases of "cold in the head" as well as in constant irritation
from adenoids, then may follow a vast train of difficulties&mdash;earache,
mastoiditis, etc.&mdash;with the result that the tiny bones
in the middle ear which vibrate so exquisitely may become
ankylosed (stiffened) and deafness often follow. Everything
known must be done to prevent baby's catching "cold in the
head." If the sinuses become infected it may also lead to
serious consequences.</p>

<p>When the nose becomes clogged it may be opened up by repeatedly
disinfecting the inside of the nose with oily sprays such
as simple albolene or camphorated-albolene spray.</p>

<p>The bowels should be quickly opened by castor oil, and the
feedings should be cut down at least two-thirds or one-half.</p>

<p>Public drinking cups should always be avoided and kissing the
baby be tabooed.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span></p>

<h4>GRIPPE</h4>

<p>The treatment of influenza in infancy and childhood is to avoid
contact with an older person suffering with the grippe. Ordinarily,
the so-called "grippe" is a common, mixed infection&mdash;not
true influenza. Coryza and cough are the chief respiratory
symptoms which attend these widespread epidemics. Often
vomiting and diarrhea are seen in the young sufferers.</p>

<p>In cases of grippe put the child to bed and call the doctor. In
the case of the older children, the treatment and care to be recommended
has been fully outlined by the author in the little
work entitled <i>The Cause and Cure of Colds</i>.</p>

<p>Complications from the grippe are very frequent in children&mdash;such
as severe diarrhea, enlarged glands of the neck, running
ears, bronchitis, pneumonia, and sometimes tuberculosis.</p>

<p>Every effort should be put forth to isolate and quarantine the
first member of the family to be stricken with grippe so that the
remaining members may, if possible, escape an uncomfortable
and unhappy siege.</p>

<h4>SORE THROAT</h4>

<p>The danger of permanent deafness which so often follows a
sore throat as well as a cold in the head, should cause every
mother or caretaker earnestly to begin treatment at the very first
sign of a sore throat. When a little baby gulps or cries on swallowing,
a sore throat should always be suspected and remedial
measures promptly instituted.</p>

<p>A most convenient article with which to examine an infant's
throat is a small pocket flashlight. The pillars of the throat or
the tonsils or both may be much inflamed, and since tonsillitis,
diphtheria, and scarlet fever all begin with a sore throat, it is
wise early to seek medical counsel in order that the differential
diagnosis may be promptly made. We urge the mother, as a
rule, not to attempt to diagnose severe cases of sore throat.
Send for the physician.</p>

<p>Tonsillitis is a severe form of sore throat which, fortunately,
rarely troubles tiny infants; but for every sore throat, while
waiting for medical help to arrive, lay your plans to empty the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
bowels, diminish the quantity of the food, swab or spray the
throat, and later closely follow the physician's advice concerning
the general treatment of the child.</p>

<h4>ADENOIDS</h4>

<p>Adenoid growths appear as grape-like lymphoid formations
located in the upper and posterior-nasal pharynx. These adenoids
secrete a very toxic, thickened fluid, which slowly makes
its way down along the back wall of the throat, and reddens and
inflames first the anterior and posterior pillars of the throat and
then often inflames and enlarges the tonsils.</p>

<p>Adenoids not only obstruct the respiratory passage way to the
throat and lungs, but they also exert a harmful influence on the
general physical and mental development of the child.</p>

<p>It is nothing less than criminal for heedless parents to allow
adenoid growths to remain in the child's post-nasal pharynx.
The little fellow's face is disfigured, more or less for life, his
mentality dulled, while he is compelled to breathe through his
mouth.</p>

<p>An almost miraculous change often follows the complete removal
of these obstructive adenoids&mdash;the child takes a renewed
interest in everything about him. More oxygen finds its way to
the tissues, his face takes on better color, he gains in weight,
in fact, there appears to be a complete rejuvenation mentally
and physically.</p>

<p>The signs or symptoms of adenoids are mouth breathing, restlessness
at night, snoring, recurring colds, nasal discharge, swelling
of the glands of the neck, poor nutrition, loss of appetite,
bed wetting, impaired hearing, lack of attention, and mental
dullness. The removal of adenoids is neither a serious or difficult
procedure, and they may safely be removed at any age.</p>

<h4>DISEASED TONSILS</h4>

<p>Tonsils which remain permanently enlarged and show signs
of disease and debilitation&mdash;filled crypts&mdash;may be removed as
early as the fourth or fifth year, if necessary. If proper treatment
does not improve the tonsils as the child grows older, their
removal should seriously be considered. The tonsils may serve<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
some special secretory or defensive function during the first few
years of life and we think best, therefore, not to advise their
removal&mdash;except in extreme cases&mdash;until the child is at least
four or five years old.</p>

<p>When it is necessary to attack the tonsils, they should be
thoroughly dissected out&mdash;not merely burned or clipped off.
If they are properly removed, the danger of heart trouble,
rheumatism, and many other infections may be considered as
greatly lessened.</p>

<p>After five years of age the normal tonsils should begin to
shrink, and at about the beginning of adolescence they should
be no larger than a small lima bean, hidden almost completely
out of sight behind the pillars of the throat. While healthy tonsils
may serve some useful purpose even in the adult, it is almost
universally conceded that the thoroughly bad and diseased tonsil
is utterly useless to the body&mdash;only an open gateway for the
entrance of infection.</p>

<h4>BRONCHITIS</h4>

<p>A very common disorder of early infancy and childhood is
bronchitis&mdash;an inflammation of the bronchial tubes&mdash;accompanied
by severe coughing. Its tendency to pass into pneumonia
renders it a disease for skilled hands to treat&mdash;a disorder hardly
safe for even the well-meaning mother to undertake to manage
without medical advice and help. And since bronchitis is usually
accompanied by alarming symptoms of high fever, weakened
heart, embarrassed breathing, mottled or blue skin, green stools,
troublesome cough, disturbed sleep, "stopped up nose," and
"choked up throat," it is of utmost importance not only to
seek medical aid early, but also that the mother, herself, should
have definite ideas concerning the proper manner of doing the
following things in the line of treatment:</p>

<ol>
<li>Making and applying a mustard paste.</li>
<li>The fashioning of an oil-silk jacket.</li>
<li>Improvising a steam tent.</li>
<li>Flushing out the colon, and a score of other things which the watchful doctor may want given any moment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">305</a></span></li>
</ol>

<p><i>Mustard Pastes</i> are prepared by mixing one part of mustard
and six parts of flour in warm water and applying to the chest
between two pieces of thin muslin. It is left on just seven
minutes and then talcum powder is thickly sprinkled on the
moist, reddened skin; this powder quickly absorbs all the moisture
and leaves the skin in a good condition&mdash;ready for another
paste in three hours if it is so ordered.</p>

<p><i>The Oil-Silk Jacket</i>, or pneumonia jacket, consists of three
layers&mdash;the inside of cheesecloth, an inner thin sheet of cotton
wadding, and an outside layer of oil silk (procurable at any
drug store). It should open on the shoulder and under the arm
on the same side. It is worn constantly (change for fresh
cheesecloth and cotton every day) during the inflammatory
stage; it is removed only during the mustard pastes.</p>

<p><i>A Steam Tent</i> may be prepared by placing a sheet over the
infant's crib and allowing steam to enter from a large paper
funnel placed in the nose of a tea kettle of boiling water kept
hot on a small stove of some sort.</p>

<p>The mattress and bedding are covered with rubber sheeting
and the infant's clothes protected from moisture. The baby
should remain in this steamy atmosphere ten minutes at a time.</p>

<p>Another method is to hold baby in arms near the large end
of a big funnel placed in a tea kettle on the gas stove or range,
and then have an assistant help hold a sheet tent over both the
mother and babe. Or the baby carriage may be placed over a
small tub of water into which are dropped several hot bricks.
A sheet canopy spread over the carriage holds the steam in and
baby reaps the benefits of the warm moisture.</p>

<p><i>Colonic Flushing</i> is necessary when green stools accompany
bronchitis. A well-lubricated end of a large Davidson's syringe
is inserted into the rectum, and with the hips of the baby brought
to the edge of a basin (the heels held in the hands of the assistant),
water is forced into the rectum. Not more than one ordinary
cup of water should be introduced at any one time. After
expulsion, another may be gently injected.</p>

<p><i>The diet</i> in bronchitis is always reduced so that no extra
work will be thrown on the already overtaxed constitution of
the child.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">306</a></span></p>

<p><i>Absolute rest</i> is necessary and perfect quiet should prevail.
The humidity of the room should not be lower than 50 at any
time, while the air should be moderately cool and fresh.</p>

<p>Numerous other details which may be necessary in the management
of bronchitis will be directed by the physicians and
nurses in charge of the case.</p>

<h4>SPASMODIC CROUP</h4>

<p>It is believed that children with enlarged tonsils and adenoids
are much more subject to croup than others. Although very
sudden in its onset and very alarming, spasmodic croup, fortunately,
is seldom dangerous. A little child goes to bed in
apparently normal condition and wakes up suddenly with a
coarse metallic cough, difficult breathing, and with a distressed
expression on the face.</p>

<p>Alternate hot and cold compresses should be applied to the
throat&mdash;first the hot cloths (wrung from very hot water) being
applied over the throat, which should <ins class="typo" title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'he'">be</ins> covered with a single
thickness of dry flannel. Then after three minutes of the hot
cloths a very cold cloth is applied to the skin itself for one half
minute; then more of the hot compress, followed again by the
short cold, until five such changes have been made. A bronchitis
tent should be quickly improvised so that the child can be
"steamed."</p>

<p>Vomiting must be produced by kerosene (three or four drops
on sugar), alum and molasses, or ipecac (ten drops every fifteen
minutes). Some remedy must be administered continuously
until free vomiting occurs. A good dose of castor oil should be
given after the spasm. Suitable treatment should be administered
through the day to prevent a recurrence of the attack the
next night.</p>

<p>The general vital resistance should be raised by outdoor life,
improved circulation, good food; adenoids if present, should
be removed.</p>

<p>Medical advice should be sought in every case of severe croup,
for membraneous croup usually is indicative of diphtheria, and
the diagnosis is important, as on it hangs the determination of
the administration of antitoxin.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span></p>

<h4>PNEUMONIA</h4>

<p>Pneumonia is always a serious disease. It is accompanied by
high fever, painful, very short cough, and rapid breathing with
a moving in and out of the edges of the nose as well as the
spaces between the ribs. The possibilities of complications are
always great&mdash;the dangers are many&mdash;so that the combined
watchfulness of both the mother and a proficient trained nurse
are required; not to mention the skill of the physician.</p>

<p>The steam tent, the mustard paste, the oil-silk jacket and the
colonic flushing (described earlier in this chapter) may all be
asked for by the physician in his untiring efforts to prevent dangerous
complications during the course of the disease.</p>

<p>Plenty of moderately cool, fresh air (without drafts) is of
great benefit. Never allow blue finger tips, or cold ear tips to
exist; send at once for the doctor and administer a hot bath, or
wrap in a sheet dipped in hot mustard water while awaiting his
arrival. No mother should think of attempting to carry her
baby through an attack of bronchitis or pneumonia without the
best medical help available.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXX</h2>
<h2>THE NERVOUS CHILD</h2>
</div>

<p>While each child possesses an individuality all its own,
nevertheless, there are certain general principles of
psychologic conduct and family discipline which are more or
less applicable to all children. The so-called nervous child, in
addition to the usual methods of child culture, stands in need
of special attention as concerns its early discipline and training.
This chapter will, therefore, be devoted to special suggestions
with regard to the management and training of those children
who are by heredity predisposed to nervousness, over-excitability,
and who possess but a minimum of self-control.</p>

<h4>HEREDITARY NERVOUSNESS</h4>

<p>The so-called nervous child&mdash;all things equal&mdash;is the child
who is born into the world with an unbalanced or inefficiently
controlled nervous system; and while it is all too true that the
common nursery methods of "spoiling the child" are often
equally to blame with heredity for the production of an erratic
disposition and an uncontrolled temper, nevertheless, it is now
generally recognized that the foundation of the difficulties of
the nervous child reaches back into its immediate and remote
ancestral heredity.</p>

<p>I no longer doubt but that many of these babies with a bad
nervous heredity, who are born predisposed to Saint Vitus'
dance, bad temper, chronic worry, neurasthenia, and hysteria
could be spared much of their early troubles and later miseries
by prompt and proper methods of early nursery discipline.</p>

<p>These nervous babies are born into the world with an abnormal
lack of self-control. Their "inhibition control" over
the natural and spontaneous tendency of the nervous system to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">309</a></span>
manifest its inherent impulses and passing whims is decidedly
deficient. The child is unduly sensitive, whines, hollers, or flies
into a violent rage when its will is crossed in the least degree.
Such a child sometimes keeps its mother living in constant terror
because, when its will is crossed in any particular, it will scream
and hold its breath until it turns black in the face and sometimes
actually goes into a convulsion.</p>

<p>In dealing with these unfortunate little ones, fathers and
mothers, while they should be firm and persistent in their methods
of correction, should also be kind and patient; fully recognizing
that whatever undesirable traits the little ones manifest
they have come by honestly&mdash;these naughty tendencies being
the result either of heredity or spoiling, for both of which the
parents stand responsible.</p>

<h4>EARLY TRAINING</h4>

<p>One of the very first things that a child, especially the nervous
child, should learn is that crying and other angerful manifestations
accomplish absolutely nothing. The greatest part of the
successful training of the nervous child should take place before
it is three and one-half years of age. It should early learn to
lie quietly in its little bed and be entirely happy without receiving
any attention or having any fuss made over it. It should
not become the center of a circle of admiring and indulgent
family friends and caretakers who will succeed in effectually
destroying what little degree of self-control it may be fortunate
enough to possess.</p>

<p>When the little one is discovered to be nervous, fretful, impatient,
and easily irritated early in the morning, it should be
left alone in its bed or in the nursery until it quiets down. If
it has a good, healthy crying spell, leave it alone. Let it early
get used to living with itself&mdash;teach the little fellow to get
along with the world as it is&mdash;and you will do a great deal
toward preventing a host of neurasthenic miseries and a flood
of hysterical sorrows later on in life.</p>

<p>You must not expect to train the nervous child by the simple
and easy methods which are successful in the case of a normal
child; that is, you cannot repeat a simple discipline two or three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">310</a></span>
times and have the child learn the lesson. In the case of the
high-strung nervous child it requires "line upon line and precept
upon precept;" for, whereas a normal child will respond to
a certain discipline after it is repeated a half dozen times, the
nervous child will require the persistent repetition of such a
discipline from twenty-five to one hundred times before the
lesson sinks into his consciousness sufficiently to enable
him to gain control of his erratic and unbalanced nervous
mechanism.</p>

<h4>SPOILING THE CHILD</h4>

<p>As bad as all spoiling methods are in child culture, they are
decidedly disastrous&mdash;almost fatal&mdash;in the case of the nervous
child; and yet it is these delicate, sensitive, cute little things that
are the very ones who are most frequently the worst spoiled.
Nervous children simply must not be played with all the time.
They must be by themselves a great deal, at least this is true
in their earlier years.</p>

<p>The nervous baby must early learn absolute respect for authority,
so that what it lacks in its own nervous control may be
partially made up for by parental suggestion and discipline. Of
course, as suggested in a later chapter, the more ideal methods
of suggestion, education, and persuasion should be employed in
your efforts to secure obedience and promote self-control; but,
when through either the deep-rooted incorrigibility of a child,
or the inefficiency of the parent's efforts in the employment of
suggestion&mdash;no matter what the cause of the failure of your
ideal methods to control temper, stop crying, or otherwise put
down the juvenile rebellion, whether the child has been spoiled
on account of company, sickness or through your carelessness&mdash;when
you cannot effectively and immediately enforce your will
any other way, do not hesitate to punish; spank promptly and
vigorously and spank repeatedly if necessary to accomplish your
purpose. You must not fail in the case of the nervous child to
accomplish exactly what you start out to do.</p>

<p>When the little fellow wakes up in the night and cries, see
if he needs anything and administer to him. If you have previously
tried the method of letting him "cry it out," which is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">311</a></span>
usually entirely sufficient in the case of a normal child, and if
such treatment does not seem to cure him, then speak to him
firmly, give him to understand that he must stop crying, and
if he does not, turn him over and administer a good spanking&mdash;and
repeat if necessary to get results. In dealing with a nervous
child we must follow the directions on the bottle of the old-fashioned
liniment "rub in until relief is obtained."</p>

<p>No "spoiling practices" should be countenanced in the case
of nervous children. They should be taught to sleep undisturbed
in a room in the presence of usual noises. They should
not be allowed to grow up with a sleeping-room always darkened
by day and a light to sleep by at night. They should be taught
to sleep on without being disturbed even if someone does enter
the room; they should be taught to sleep normally without having
to quiet and hush the whole neighborhood.</p>

<h4>PLAYMATES</h4>

<p>The early play of nervous children should be carefully supervised
and organized. Under no circumstance should they be
allowed exclusively to play with children younger than themselves.
They must not be allowed to dictate and control their
playmates; it is far better that they should play at least a part
of the time with older children who will force them to occupy
subordinate r&ocirc;les in their affairs of play; in this way much may
be accomplished toward preventing the development of a selfish,
headstrong, and intolerant attitude. When the nervous child
is miffed or peeved at play and wants to quit because he cannot
have his way, see to it that he quickly takes his place back in the
ranks of his playfellows, and thus early teach him how to
react to defeat and disappointment. The nervous child must
not be allowed to grow up with a disposition that will in some
later crisis cause him to "get mad and quit."</p>

<p>If the nervous baby has older brothers and sisters, see to it
that he does not, through pet and peeve and other manifestations
of temper, control the family and thus dictate the trend of all
the children's play. Early train him to be manly, to play fair,
and when his feelings are hurt or things do not go just to his
liking, teach him, in the language of the street, to be "game."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">312</a></span>
It is equally important that the little girls be taught in the same
way how to take disappointment and defeat without murmur or
complaint.</p>

<h4>TEACHING SELF-CONTROL</h4>

<p>When nervous children grow up, especially if their parents
are well to do, and they are not forced to work for a living,
they are prone to develop into erratic, neurasthenic, and hysterical
women, and worrying, inefficient, and nervous men; and
in later years they throng the doctor's offices with both their
real and imaginary complaints. These patients always feel that
they are different from other people, that something terrible is
the matter with them or that something awful is about to happen
to them. Their brains constantly swarm with fears and
premonitions of disease, disaster, and despair, while their otherwise
brilliant intellects are confused and handicapped because of
these "spoiled" and "hereditary" nervous disturbances&mdash;with
the result that both their happiness and usefulness in life is
largely destroyed.</p>

<p>The fundamental abnormal characteristic of that great group
of nerve-patients who throng the doctor's office is sensitiveness,
suggestibility, and lack of self-control. Sensitiveness is nothing
more or less than a refined form of selfishness, while lack of
self-control is merely the combined end-product of heredity and
childhood spoiling. I am a great believer in, and practitioner
of, modern methods of psychological child culture, but let me
say to the fond parent who has a nervous child, when you have
failed to teach the child self-control by suggestive methods, do
not hesitate to punish, for of all cases it is doubly true of the
nervous child that if you "spare the rod" you are sure to "spoil
the child."</p>

<p>Let me urge parents to secure this self-control and enforce
this discipline before the child is three or four years of age;
correct the child at a time when your purpose can be accomplished
without leaving in his subconscious mind so many vivid
memories of these personal and, sometimes, more or less brutal
physical encounters. Every year you put off winning the disciplinary
fight with your offspring, you enormously increase the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">313</a></span>
danger and likelihood of alienating his affections and otherwise
destroying that beautiful and sympathetic relationship which
should always exist between a child and his parents. In other
words, the older the child, the less the good you accomplish by
discipline and the more the personal resentment toward the
parent is aroused on the part of the child.</p>

<h4>CRIME AND INTEMPERANCE</h4>

<p>While it is generally admitted that feeble-mindedness lies at
the foundation of most crime, we must also recognize that
failure on the part of parents to teach their children self-control
is also responsible for many otherwise fairly normal youths
falling into crime and intemperance. The parents of a nervous
child must recognize that they will in all probability be subject
to special danger along these lines as they grow up. The nervous
child, as it grows up, is quite likely to be erratic, emotional,
indecisive, and otherwise easily influenced by his associates and
environment.</p>

<p>Nervous children are more highly suggestible than others, and
if they have not been taught to control their appetites and desires,
their wants and passions, they are going to form an
especially susceptible class of society from which may be recruited
high-class criminals, dipsomaniacs, and other unfortunates.</p>

<p>It is true that any spoiled child, however normal its heredity,
may turn out bad in these respects if it is not properly trained;
but what we are trying to accomplish here is to emphasize to
parents that the nervous child is doubly prone to go wrong and
suffer much sorrow in after life if he is not early and effectively
taught self-control.</p>

<h4>UNSPOILING THE CHILD</h4>

<p>If the child of nervous tendencies forms the habit of crying,
sulking, or otherwise misbehaving when it is denied its desires,
or when something it wants done is not immediately attended
to, it will be found an excellent plan simply to stand still and let
the little fellow have it out with himself, in the meanwhile
kindly reminding him to say, "please mamma," "please papa,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">314</a></span>
etc. I well remember one nervous little girl who would yell
at the top of her voice and become black in the face the moment
she wanted a door opened or anything else. A few weeks of
patience and firmness on the part of the mother entirely cured
her of this unbecoming trait.</p>

<p>As a rule, it will be found best not to argue with the nervous
child. The moment your commands are not heeded, when you
have admonished the child once or twice without effect, take
him quickly to the crib or the nursery and there leave him alone,
isolated, until he is in a state of mind to manifest a kindly spirit
and an obedient disposition. It is an excellent plan quietly and
quickly to deprive such children of their pleasures temporarily,
in order to produce thoughtfulness; and these methods are often
more efficacious than the infliction of varying degrees of pain
under the guise of punishment.</p>

<p>Nervous children must be taught to go to sleep by themselves.
They are not to be rocked or allowed to hold the hand of the
mother or the caretaker. The nervous baby should not be encouraged
to exhibit its cuteness for the delectation of the family
or the amusement of strangers and visitors. He should be
especially trained in early and regular habits, taking particular
pains to see that bed wetting and similar bad habits are early
overcome; otherwise, he may drag along through early life and
become the cause of great embarrassment both to himself and
his parents.</p>

<p>The control of these nervous habits is somewhat like the management
of the slipping of the wheels of a locomotive when the
track is wet and slippery. The little folks ofttimes endeavor to
apply the brakes, but they are minus the sand which keeps the
wheels from slipping. The parent, with his well-planned discipline,
is able to supply this essential element, and thus the child
is enabled to gain a sufficient amount of self-control to prevent
him making a continuous spectacle of himself.</p>

<p>When nervous children do not walk or talk early, let them
alone. Of course, if later on it is discovered that they are manifestly
backward children, something must be done about it; but
if the nervous child is encouraged to talk too soon there is great
danger of his developing into a stutterer or a stammerer.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">315</a></span></p>

<h4>PREVENTING HYSTERIA</h4>

<p>Every year we have pass through our hands men and women,
especially women, who possess beautiful characters, who have
noble intellects, and who have high aims and holy ambitions in
life, but whose careers have been well-nigh ruined, almost shattered,
because of the hysterical tendency which ever accompanies
them, and which, just as soon as the stress and strain
of life reaches a certain degree of intensity, unfailingly produces
its characteristic breakdown; the patient is seized with
confusion, is overcome by feeling, indulges in an emotional
sprawl, is flooded with terrible apprehensions and distracting
sensations, may even go into a convulsive fit, and, in extreme
cases, even become unconscious and rigidly stiff.</p>

<p>Now, in the vast majority of cases, if this nervous patient,
when a baby, had been thoroughly disciplined and taught proper
self-control before it was four years of age, it would have
developed into quite a model little citizen; and while throughout
life it would have borne more or less of a hysteria
stigma, nevertheless it would have possessed a sufficient amount
of self-control to have gotten along with dignity and success;
in fact, the possibilities are so tremendous, the situation
is so terrible in the case of these nervous babies, that we might
almost say that, in the majority of such, success and failure
in life will be largely determined by the early and effective
application of these methods of preventive discipline.</p>

<p>I was recently consulted by a patient whose nervous system
was in a deplorable state, who had lost almost complete mental
control of herself, and who really presented a pathetic spectacle
as she told of the fears and worries that enthralled her. In an
effort to get to the bottom of this patient's heredity I had a
conference with her father, and I learned that this woman, in
her childhood days, had been constantly humored&mdash;allowed to
have everything she wanted. She was a delicate and sensitive
little thing and the parents could not bear to hear her cry, it
made her sick, it gave her convulsions, it produced sleepless
nights, it destroyed her appetite, and so she grew up in this
pampered way. The father recognized the greatness of his mis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">316</a></span>take
and he told me with tears in his eyes how, when the ringing
of the school bell disturbed his little girl baby, he saw the
school directors and had them stop ringing the bell, and he even
stopped the ringing of the church bells. He was an influential
citizen and could even stop the blowing of the whistles if it disturbed
his precious little daughter.</p>

<p>And so this woman has grown up with this nervous system
naturally weakened by heredity and further weakened by "spoiling";
and fortunate indeed she will be if off and on the most
of her life she is not seeking the advice of a physician in her
efforts to gain that self-control which her parents could have
so easily put in her possession at the time she was three or four
years of age, if they had only spent a few hours then, instead
of the many months and years that subsequently have been devoted
to medical attention.</p>

<h4>METHODS OF DISCIPLINE</h4>

<p>We run into many snags when we undertake to discipline the
nervous baby. The first is that it will sometimes cry so hard
that it will get black in the face and may even have a convulsion;
occasionally a small blood vessel may be ruptured on some
part of the body, usually the face. When you see the little one
approaching this point, turn it over and administer a sound
spanking and it will instantly catch its breath. This will not
have to be repeated many times until that particular difficulty
will be largely under control.</p>

<p>It will be discovered when you undertake to break a bad
habit in the case of a spoiled child who is of a nervous temperament,
that your discipline interferes with the child's appetite and
nutrition. The delicate little creature who has perhaps already
given you no end of trouble regarding its feeding, will begin to
lose in weight, and even the doctor often becomes so alarmed
that he advises against all further methods of discipline. We
think this is usually a mistake. Both the nutrition and discipline
should be kept in mind and carried harmoniously through to a
successful finish. It will be necessary during such troublous
times to conserve both the physical and nervous strength of the
child; it should not be allowed to run about and over-play, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">317</a></span>
such high strung children often do. It should be given a reasonable
amount of physical exercise, and two or three times a day
should have short periods of complete isolation in the nursery,
where it may quietly play with its blocks and toys, sing and
croon or talk as the case may be, but should be left entirely
alone.</p>

<p>Wise efforts should be put forth to keep the feeding up to the
proper number of calories, and to see, if the child does not gain
during this disciplinary struggle, that at least it does not lose;
and I give it as my experience that I have yet to see a case in
which both the child's nutrition and discipline cannot be efficiently
maintained at one and the same time, though it does
sometimes require adroit scientific and artistic management. But
the game we are playing is worth the effort&mdash;the battle must be
fought&mdash;and it can be fought with the least suffering and sorrowing
the earlier the conflict is waged to a successful issue.</p>

<p>I am decidedly opposed to allowing these young nervous children
to over-play and thus wear themselves out unduly. This
over exhaustion sometimes renders the training of the child
much more difficult, as it is a well-known fact that we are all
much more irritable and lacking in self-control when we are
tired, more especially when we are over-tired and fatigued.</p>

<p>Let me emphasize the importance and value of proper periods
of isolation&mdash;complete rest and partial physical relaxation.
You can take a child who has gotten up wrong in the morning,
whose nerves are running away with him, who is irritable,
crying at everything that happens, who even rejects the food
prepared for him, and who, when spoken to and commanded to
stop crying, yells all the louder&mdash;I say you can take such a
little one back to its crib, place it in the bed and smilingly walk
out of the room. After a transient outburst of crying, within
a very few minutes you can return to find a perfect little angel,
winsome and smiling, happy and satisfied, presenting an entirely
different picture from the little culprit so recently incarcerated
as a punishment for his unseemly conduct.</p>

<p>But let me repeat that while such methods of discipline often
work like magic on normal children, they must be repeated again
and again in the case of one who is nervous in order to establish<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">318</a></span>
new association groups in the brain and to form new habit
grooves in his developing nervous system.</p>

<h4>RESPECT FOR AUTHORITY</h4>

<p>There are just two things the nervous child must grow up to
respect; one is authority and the other is the rights and privileges
of his associates. The nervous child needs early to learn
to reach a conclusion and to render a decision&mdash;to render a
decision without equivocation&mdash;to move forward in obedience
to that decision without quibbling and without question; that is
the thing the nervous man and woman must learn in connection
with the later conquest of their own nerves; and a foundation
for such a mastery of one's unruly nerves is best laid early
in life&mdash;by teaching the child prompt and unquestioning obedience
to parental commands. At the same time, endeavor so to
raise the child that it acquires the faculty of quickly and agreeably
adapting itself to its environment, at the same time cheerfully
recognizing the rights of its fellows.</p>

<p>It is a crime against the nervous child to allow it to hesitate,
to debate, or to falter about any matter that pertains to the
execution of parental commands. Let your rule be&mdash;speak
once, then spank. Never for a moment countenance anything
resembling dilatoriness or procrastination, let the child grow up
to recognize these as its greatest dangers, never to be tolerated
for one moment.</p>

<h4>FALSE SYMPATHY</h4>

<p>We are aware that many good people in perusing this chapter
will think that some of the advice here given is both cruel and
hard hearted; but we can safely venture the opinion that those
who have reared many children, at least if they have had some
nervous little ones, will be able to discern the meaning and significance
of most of our suggestions. Sympathy is a beautiful
and human trait and we want nothing in this chapter in any way
to interfere with that characteristic sympathy of a parent for
its offspring&mdash;the proverbial "as a father pitieth his children"&mdash;nevertheless,
there is a great deal of sympathy that is utterly
false, that is of the nature of a disastrous compromise, for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">319</a></span>
time being making it easy for both parent and child, but making
things unutterably more difficult later on in life when both
(or perhaps the child alone) must face the calamitous consequences
of this failure early to inculcate the principles of self-control
and self-mastery on the mind and character of the
nervous child.</p>

<p>We so often hear "mother love" eulogized. It is a wonderful
and self-denying human trait; but, as a physician, I have
been led to believe that "mother loyalty" is of almost equal or
even greater value. All mothers love their children more or
less, but only a few mothers possess that superb loyalty which
is able to rise above human sympathy and maternal love, which
qualifies the mother to stand smilingly by the side of the crib
and watch her little one in a fit of anger&mdash;yelling at the top of
its voice&mdash;and yet never touch the child, allow the little fellow
to come to himself, to wake up to the fact that all his yelling,
his emotion, his anger, and his resentment are absolutely powerless
to move his mother. Thus has the mother&mdash;by her loyalty
to the little fellow&mdash;taught him a new lesson in self-control,
and thus has she added one more strong link in the chain of
character which parent and child are forging day by day, and
which finally must determine both the child's temporal and
eternal destiny.</p>

<h4>SYSTEM AND ORDER</h4>

<p>System and order are desirable acquisitions for all children,
but they are absolutely indispensable to the successful rearing of
the nervous child, who should be taught to have a place for
everything and everything in its place. When he enters the
house his clothes must not be thoughtlessly thrown about. Every
garment must be put in its proper place. These little folks must
be taught a systematic and regular way of doing things.</p>

<p>Nervous children must not be allowed to procrastinate. They
must not be allowed to put off until tomorrow anything which
can be done today. They must be taught how to keep the working
decks of life clear&mdash;caught right up to the minute. They
should be taught proper methods of analysis&mdash;how to go to the
bottom of things&mdash;how to render a decision, execute it, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">320</a></span>
then move forward quickly to the next task of life. When they
come home from school with home work to do it would be best,
as a rule, first to do the school work before engaging in play.
In fact, all the methods which are needful for the proper discipline
of the ordinary child are more than doubly needful for
the training of the nervous child; while more than fourfold persistence
is needed on the part of parents to make them really
effective.</p>

<h4>EMOTIONAL RUNAWAYS</h4>

<p>Whether the child be two years of age or ten years of age,
when the parent discovers that the nervous system is "losing
its head," that the child is embarking on a nervous runaway, or
that it is about to indulge in an emotional sprawl, it is best to
interfere suddenly and spectacularly. Lay a firm hand on him
and bring things to a sudden stop. Speak to him calmly and
deliberately, but firmly. Set him on a chair, put him in the bed,
or take him to a room and isolate him.</p>

<p>In the case of the older children, tell them a story of the
horse which becomes frightened, loses self-control, and tears
off down the highway, wrecking the vehicle and throwing out its
occupants. Explain to them that many of the mistakes of life
are made during the times of these emotional runaways, these
passing spells of lost self-control. Tell the little folks that you
have perfect confidence in them if they will only take time to stop
and think before they talk or act. Explain to them that since
you saw that they were rapidly approaching a foolish climax
you thought it was your duty to call a halt, to stop them long
enough to enable them to collect their wits and indulge in some
sober thinking.</p>

<p>Personally, we have found it to be a good plan not to be
too arbitrary with the little folks, like putting them on a chair
and saying, "You must sit there one hour by the clock." They
usually begin to indulge in resentful thoughts and a situation
is often produced akin to that of the stern father who felt
compelled to go back and thrash his boy three different times
during his hour on the chair, because of what he was satisfied
was going through the boy's mind. No, that is not usually the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">321</a></span>
best way. Put them on the chair with an indeterminate sentence.
I prefer to carry it out something like this: "Now,
son, this will never do; you are running away with yourself.
Stop for a moment and think. Now I am going to ask you to
sit down in that chair there and think this over quietly. I
will be in the next room. Whenever you think you have got
control of yourself and have thought this thing out so you can
talk with me, you may get up from the chair and come into
the room to me." Sometimes five minutes, sometimes fifteen
minutes, and the little fellow will walk in and talk to you in
a very satisfactory manner. He will give you his viewpoint
and you will be able to adjust the matter in a spirit of conference
which will be satisfactory to both parent and child,
without doing the least violence to the responsibility of the one
or the individuality of the other.</p>

<p>Very little is to be accomplished, when the child starts to
indulge in an emotional runaway, if the parent contracts the
same spirit, begins to talk fast and loud, to gesticulate wildly,
grabs the child, begins to slap and shake it&mdash;that is merely an
exhibition on the part of the parent of the very same weakness
he is trying to correct in his offspring. I am afraid it is entirely
too true that for every time you shake one demon out of a
child in anger, you shake in seven worse devils. When all
other methods fail and you must resort to punishment, do it
with kindness, deliberation, and dignity. Never punish a
child in haste and anger.</p>

<h4>THE FINAL REWARD</h4>

<p>The advice offered in this chapter is not mere theory. It
has been successfully used by many parents in the management
of their nervous children, and while all principles of
child culture must be carefully wrought out and made applicable
to the particular child in question, nevertheless, the methods
of repeated and firm discipline herein set forth will enable
you to take many a child who has been born into this world
almost neurologically bankrupt, and, by this training and discipline,
enable him in adult life to draw such dividends of self-control
and self-mastery as will far exceed the outward results<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">322</a></span>
obtained in the case of many children who are born with sound
nervous systems, but who were early spoiled and allowed to
grow up without that discipline which is so essential to later
self-control and dignity of character.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXI</h2>
<h2>NERVOUS DISEASES</h2>
</div>

<p>In this chapter we shall consider a number of the more common
diseases which are associated with the nervous system
of the child. Some of these so-called nervous diseases
are hereditary or congenital, while others are the result of infection
and environment.</p>

<h4>SLEEPLESSNESS&mdash;INSOMNIA</h4>

<p>There are many conditions which cause sleeplessness or
insomnia in a child aside from disturbance of the mental state
or nervous system. For instance, late romping, too hearty and
too late a dinner, lack of outdoor life during the day, illy
ventilated sleeping rooms, too much bedding, too little bedding
which causes cold extremities, too much sleep during the day,
too much excitement (movies or receptions), intestinal indigestion
which is associated with accumulation of gas, and constipation&mdash;any
or all of these are causes of sleeplessness. Some
peculiarly nervous children&mdash;those with an hereditary strain
of nervousness&mdash;are easily upset or disturbed by any of the
conditions above mentioned.</p>

<p>The treatment of insomnia consists, first, in finding the
cause and removing it. Children with a nervous tendency
should be let alone as nearly as possible, and just allowed to
grow up as the little lambs and calves grow up. They should
be fed, watered, kept clean and dry, and allowed to live their
lives undisturbed and without excitement.</p>

<p>The medicinal remedies on the market for insomnia are all
harmful if used too long or in excess, and we most earnestly
urge the mother not to seek drug-store information concerning
remedies for sleeplessness. The neutral bath is beneficial in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">324</a></span>
ninety per cent of these cases. It is administered as follows:
Enough water is allowed to run into the bath tub to cover the
child. The temperature should be 99 to 100 F. It should be
taken accurately&mdash;and should be maintained. Bath tub thermometers
may be purchased at any drug store. The restless
child, after the bowels have been freely moved, is placed in
the water, and, without whispering, talking, or laughing, he
remains there for at least twenty minutes, after which he is
carefully lifted out, wrapped in a sheet and very gently dried
off with soothing strokes and placed at once into his night
clothes. As before said, ninety per cent of restless children
will go at once to sleep after such a treatment.</p>

<p>Another method of treating sleeplessness is by the wet-sheet
pack. Three single woolen blankets are placed on the bed
and a sheet large enough to wrap the child in is wrung from
warm water, about 100 F. The child is stripped and this sheet
is brought in contact with every portion of his body, quickly
followed by bringing the flannel blankets about him and he is
allowed to remain there for twenty minutes&mdash;if he does not
fall asleep before the lapse of that time. With witch-hazel
or alcohol, the body is sponged off, night clothes are put on
and a restful night usually follows. If fresh air is lacking, open
the windows. If there is too much bedding, remove some of it.
Talcum powder the sweaty back and neck and make the child
perfectly comfortable. Give a small drink of water and turn
out the light.</p>

<h4>NIGHT TERRORS</h4>

<p>Night terrors are probably due to some digestive disturbance,
with a coexisting highly nervous temperament. They oftentimes,
in older children, follow the reading of thrilling stories
or a visit to an exciting moving-picture show. The child goes
to sleep and gets along nicely for two or three hours and then
suddenly jumps up out of bed and rushes to its mother with
little or no explanation for the act. In his dreams the thoughts
and the imaginations of his waking moments are all confounded
and alarming.</p>

<p>We recall one little fellow who constantly feared big, black<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">325</a></span>
birds coming in the window and attacking him&mdash;he had been
reading about Sinbad the Sailor and his experiences with the
big bird. He so feared this big, black bird that he could not
go to sleep. For a number of nights he did not have the courage
to tell his parents that it was the fear of the big bird that
kept him from going to sleep, but finally he confided in his
mother and told her of his fear. The mother and father both
entered into a conversation with him through an open door
which connected the two rooms, after the lights were out; they
laughed and talked about the big bird, they openly talked of it
and allowed their imagination to work with the child's imagination
in planning how he could combat with the bird, should it
really come, asking him how big it really was and what color
he thought its eyes were and how big an object he thought
its feet could carry. They all three planned a fairy story they
might write which would rival the fairy stories of the Arabian
Nights. In a very short time&mdash;possibly a week or ten days&mdash;the
little fellow felt quite equal to these imaginary assaults,
his fears were quieted and his slumbers were no more disturbed
by visions of the big, black bird.</p>

<p>Everything should be done to relieve the stomach and intestines
of laborious work during the sleeping hours, hence let the
evening meal be light and eaten early enough to be out of the
way, as far as digestion is concerned, by bed time.</p>

<h4>NERVOUSNESS</h4>

<p>During the formative period of the nervous system&mdash;the
first few years&mdash;under no circumstances should the children
be played with late at night, when they are tired and sleepy,
or hungry, for it is at such times that the nervous system is
so easily excited and irritated. When the baby is to be played
with, if at all, it should be in the morning or after the mid-day
nap. Rest and peaceful surroundings are of paramount importance
to the nervous child, and he should be left alone to amuse
himself several hours each day. It is a deplorable fact that
the nervous child&mdash;the very one that should be left alone&mdash;is
the very child that usually receives the most attention, the
very one who is most petted, indulged, and pacified; all of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">326</a></span>
which only tends to increase his lack of self-control and to
multiply the future sorrows of his well-meaning but indulgent
parents.</p>

<h4>HEADACHE</h4>

<p>Headache attacks old and young alike, and the young infant
that is unable to tell us he has a headache manifests it by rolling
the head from side to side, putting his hand to his head,
or by wrinkling up his brow. Headaches may be occasioned by
disorders of the brain and spinal column, such as meningitis.
It nearly always accompanies fever, and is often a result of
constipation, intestinal indigestion, overeating, as well as eating
the wrong kind of food.</p>

<p>The treatment of headache in children (aside from removing
any known cause) consists of a hot foot bath, a brief mustard
paste to the back of the neck, a light diet&mdash;sometimes nothing
but water&mdash;and the administration of a laxative.</p>

<h4>CONVULSIONS&mdash;SPASMS</h4>

<p>In the very young, convulsions are easily produced. That
which will produce but a headache in an adult will often produce
a convulsion in the child. Aside from diseases of the
nervous system such as epilepsy, etc., convulsions frequently
accompany gas on the bowels, intestinal indigestion, disordered
dentition, an acute illness, intestinal parasites (worms), irritation
about the genitals such as the need of circumcision, an
adherent clitoris, adenoids and enlarged tonsils, inflammation
of the ears, and poor nutrition of any sort such as rickets.</p>

<p>The convulsion picture is a stiffening of the body&mdash;sometimes
arching backwards&mdash;rolling or staring of the eye-balls,
blueness of the skin, a drooling mouth (often foamy mucus at
the mouth), clinched hands, biting the teeth&mdash;if there are
teeth&mdash;and even biting the tongue. There is at first a succession
of quick, jerking, convulsive movements of the body
which in a few moments grow less and less violent and finally
cease. The child begins to cry and then soon goes off into a
deep sleep, while the body seems more heavy and logy than
usual. In extreme cases, the child relaxes but for a moment<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">327</a></span>
of time, when he goes off into another convulsion, sometimes
going from one fit into another until death relieves him.</p>

<p>Treatment for convulsions must be instituted at once. Do
not wait entirely to undress the child&mdash;pull off his shoes, place
him at once into a good warm bath, temperature about 100
to 102 F. An ice cap should be placed to his head (cracked
ice done up in a towel), and while in the bath or immediately
upon taking him out, give a warm soapsuds enema. The bath
that the child is placed in should be always tested with the
bared elbow. A half cupful of mustard may be added to the
bath. Just as soon as the child is able to swallow, give a teaspoon
of syrup of ipecac. Enema after enema should be
given until the water comes back clear. Undue excitement
after the bath only predisposes to repeated attacks, and while
the mother may be very happy that the child is himself again,
under no circumstances should she caress and fondle him.
Put the little one to bed and allow his nervous system to calm
down; let him rest quietly and undisturbed.</p>

<h4>NERVOUS TWITCHINGS</h4>

<p>Habit spasms or "tics" are common in childhood, and are
caused by an over irritability of the nerves supplying certain
groups of muscles. It is not at all uncommon to see a child
nervously blink the eyes, twitch the nasal muscles, shrug the
shoulders, constantly open and close the hand, and execute a
score of other minor habit-spasms; which, day by day, wear
deeper and deeper paths into his nervous system as a result
of their constant repetition. These minor habit-spasms of
childhood are but telltales of an unstable nervous system, of
a nervous heredity lacking poise and balance; and, mind you,
if this nervous system is studied, treated, and properly harnessed
with self-understanding and self-control, much may be accomplished;
the habit may be more or less completely eradicated. If
left to itself, unchecked, the habit deepens the "spasm-groove,"
and the "energy-leaks" grow bigger and bigger until finally,
in later, adult life, all that is necessary to convert such persons
into first-class neurasthenics or hysterics is some bad
news, a few worries, or a sudden shock.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">328</a></span></p>

<p>By all means study to nip all childhood twitchings in the
bud; remembering all the while that childhood&mdash;the formative
period for the nervous system of the child&mdash;presents the
golden opportunity to prevent and abort the more grave neuroses
of later life. There may be a special contraction of
one or more muscles of the eyeball which produces either a
"cross-eye," when the contraction is convergent, or a turning
of one eye outward when the contraction is divergent. It is
not possible for the mother to correct this condition. The
one important thing for her to do is to take the child to a
skilled ophthalmologist early in his life, that treatment may be
instituted for the correction of the difficulty.</p>

<h4>RETENTION OF URINE</h4>

<p>Not an unusual condition during childhood is a temporary
retention of urine. It may follow an attack of colic or accompany
any acute illness. Increase the water drinking, and, after
seven or eight hours, hot cloths should be applied over the
bladder; a large enema (enema bag should be hung low) should
also be given, retaining as much as is possible. These simple
measures usually relieve the condition. If retention follows
circumcision, due to swelling of the parts, the surgeon should
be notified.</p>

<h4>BED WETTING</h4>

<p>Nocturnal enuresis (bed wetting) usually is found to "run
in families." It is seldom the case to find that both the father
and the mother escaped bed wetting during childhood when
the child is sorely afflicted.</p>

<p>Early bad habits may be the prime factor in this distressing
and humiliating difficulty. A little child that has been compelled
to lie in wet diapers for hours at a time gradually
becomes accustomed to "being wet," and the desire to urinate
is not under the keen control of a will that has been trained
by untiring patience to "sit on a chair" at regular intervals
throughout the day. This lack of training in a child who
possesses an unstable nervous system, creates the proper
environment for the habit of bed wetting&mdash;which often<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">329</a></span>
marches steadily on until puberty. In the treatment of bed
wetting give attention to the following:</p>

<p>1. The urine should be thoroughly examined.</p>

<p>2. The size of the bladder should be determined.</p>

<p>3. The last meal of the day should not be after four o'clock
in the afternoon.</p>

<p>4. All during the day, in young children, systematic training
should be begun&mdash;put the child on the chair every hour, then
every hour and a half, then every two hours. Let the work
be done most painstakingly and much will be accomplished
toward training the bladder to "hold its contents" during the
night. For a time it will be necessary to set an alarm clock
to ring every three hours during the night, that the bladder may
be relieved at regular intervals.</p>

<p>5. No liquids whatever are allowed after four <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>; even the
four o'clock meal should be very light.</p>

<p>6. In older children the habit is often broken by appealing
to the pride&mdash;by requesting or demanding the child to rinse
out the bed linen and hang it up to dry himself.</p>

<p>Usually at puberty the trouble ends, and while no amount of
whipping will correct the difficulty, the promise of rewards, an
appeal to the pride, correction of dietetic errors, the establishment
of regular times to empty the bladder, the removal of all
reflex causes such as adenoids, need of circumcision, worms,
etc.&mdash;these combined influences&mdash;will bring results in the
end, if they are faithfully and intelligently applied.</p>

<h4>MENINGITIS</h4>

<p>Cerebro-spinal meningitis is not highly contagious. Children
old enough to complain of symptoms usually first complain of
an intense headache with frequent vomiting and very high
fever. Great prostration is seen, the pulse is weak, the respirations
are irregular, the child may have convulsions, or it may
have chills and fever, and rigidity of the body may be present.
The position of the child is very characteristic. It does not
want to lie on its back but usually rests on one side, with the
spine more or less arched. It is a very serious disease and
demands the early attention of a physician. Some cases are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">330</a></span>
very mild and others are exceedingly grave. If the physician
is secured early, and special remedies administered that are
known today, many of the children may be saved.</p>

<h4>INFANTILE PARALYSIS</h4>

<p>Infantile paralysis is a serious disease of the spinal cord
which comes on very suddenly and is associated with vomiting,
pain in the legs, and a high temperature. After these symptoms
have lasted a day or two the paralysis is discovered. There
may be convulsions. The paralysis is progressive, and the
wasting of the muscles increases until by the end of a couple
of months one limb is considerably shorter than the other.
Sometimes the baby goes to bed at night in apparent good
health and wakes up in the morning paralyzed.</p>

<p>In this disease the attention of the best physician in your
community should be called to the case at once, for there are
being developed in our large research laboratories special vaccines
for this condition as well as for spinal meningitis. But
what is done must be done very, very early, so let there be no
delay in calling in medical counsel.</p>

<p>There are other forms of spinal paralysis which, associated
with tuberculosis of the spine and other spinal diseases, result
in loss of power to one or more groups of muscles. The only
treatment that can be given in the home is to keep all of the
paralytic portions of the body very warm by external heat,
care being taken to avoid burning, and secure medical advice.
Often, later in the course of the disease, by the aid of crutches
and braces, the child can be taught to go to school and to get
around the house about his little duties.</p>

<p>The slight facial paralysis which is so often seen in babies
that have been delivered with forceps, usually clears up in a
few days or at the latest in a few weeks or months.</p>

<h4>SAINT VITUS' DANCE</h4>

<p>Saint Virus' dance (chorea) is a peculiar disorder seen in
nervous children, and which usually clears up in a few weeks
or months under proper treatment. It is characterized by
irregular jerkings pretty much all over the body, so that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">331</a></span>
child staggers as he walks, drops his food at the table, and executes
many other noticeably abnormal movements. The child
should be taken out of school at once and removed from
association with children who might make sport of him or
otherwise annoy him and thus increase these irregular jerkings.
He should at once be put under the direction of competent
medical authority. Simple food, colon hygiene, more or less
complete rest, and freedom from annoying circumstances, will
usually bring about a speedy recovery.</p>

<h4>CONGENITAL DISORDERS</h4>

<p><i>Water on the Brain</i> is characterized by an enlarged head
due to an increased accumulation of fluid within the cranium.
While the face remains small the head greatly increases in size
so that oftentimes it must be braced while the child is compelled
to remain in a wheel chair. The mentality is usually
fairly normal, but the enormous weight of the head compels
the life-long occupancy of a wheel chair.</p>

<p><i>Deaf-Mutism.</i> The child born deaf pays no attention whatever
to sounds. An intellectual expression is seen on his face
and by six months he is able to do all that a normal baby can
do with the exception of hearing. The child should early be
taken to an ear specialist in the endeavor, if possible, to correct
the defect of hearing. Such little ones who are destined to a
life without sound, should be given every opportunity to learn
to read the lips and to secure a good education&mdash;to be taught
a vocation where eyesight is of more value than hearing.
Special institutions are in existence today which can take
these deaf mutes when small and so teach them to make audible
sounds that they can make themselves understood&mdash;at
least partially. Lip reading is a wonderful improvement over
the deaf and dumb alphabet, and should be taught early.</p>

<p><i>Congenital Blindness.</i> Perhaps not until the child is six
months old can the observer distinguish between blindness and
idiocy. The blind child of course will not fix his eyes upon any
object; but the general lassitude and the inability to hold up
its head, while seen in idiocy, is not present in blindness.</p>

<p><i>Feeble Mindedness.</i> A baby that is born with a weak mind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">332</a></span>
is found to be very backward in all the normal developmental
attainments of the growing child. A normal baby holds up
its head at four months and should be able to sit erect at six
months. The weak-minded baby will not do this, and often as
late as two years it will not make any attempt to walk or to talk.
There is an unnatural expression&mdash;a vacant look&mdash;to the
face, while there is often much dribbling at the mouth.</p>

<p><i>Early Training should be Instituted.</i> It is necessary to call
the attention of a physician to these facts, that the parents
may be instructed in regard to the early training which is so
essential in all these weak-minded little folk. In our opinion
it is best to remove these children early to special institutions,
where their education can be superintended by those thoroughly
accomplished and accustomed to dealing with this class. There
are varying grades of feeble mindedness&mdash;the backward child
who requires a longer time to learn things, and the child who is
slow at school and possibly cannot get through more than the
fourth or fifth grade&mdash;but as soon as weak mindedness is
discovered, it is best to transfer the child to some special institution.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXII</h2>
<h2>SKIN TROUBLES</h2>
</div>

<p>One of the earliest skin troubles that the average normal
child suffers from is prickly heat&mdash;a tiny, red-pointed
rash always accompanied by sweating and usually resulting
from over-dressing, stuffy rooms, and other conditions that
make the child too warm. Prickly heat produces more or less
discomfort but usually little or no itching. Ordinarily, a sponge
bath followed by the application of talcum powder is sufficient
to give relief in mild cases; but severe or neglected cases should
be treated by means of bran baths, a cupful of bran being tied
up in a gauze bag and suspended in water until the water
assumes a milky color. Soda baths, two tablespoons to a gallon
of water, are also very soothing. A baby should never receive
any friction with a towel after such baths, but should be rolled
up in a clean linen towel and simply patted dry.</p>

<h4>CHAFING</h4>

<p>Great care should be exercised in the choice of baby's soaps.
Among a number of soaps that might be mentioned castile soap
is, perhaps, as good as any. Frequent sponging is required to
wash off the irritating perspiration; cool clothing, plenty of talcum
powder, a dose of calcined magnesia, and a regulated
diet are necessary to clear up the trouble.</p>

<p>Chafed skin, particularly between the buttocks or in other
folds and creases, should be kept free from soap. Either the
starch or bran bath may be tried, while olive oil should be
frequently and lightly rubbed over the chafed part. A bit of
sterile cotton placed between the folds to prevent friction is
often all that is necessary to correct the difficulty.</p>

<p>Dandruff or milk crust which is often seen on young babies'<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">334</a></span>
scalps has been described in detail elsewhere. It should early
receive the vaseline rub at night which will often loosen up
the hardened crusts. It may be gently removed in the morning
with soap and water unless the case has gone on to great
severity. In such neglected cases the mother should not undertake
to correct the difficulty alone. Taken early, when the
scalp is covered with tiny flakes known as milk crust, it can
be quickly relieved.</p>

<h4>VULVOVAGINITIS</h4>

<p>Vulvovaginitis is a very contagious disease, and before the
days of hospital asepsis, which is so perfectly maintained today
in our large institutions, this disease used to go right through a
children's ward because of carelessness in the handling of soiled
diapers, etc. The sign of this disease is a yellow-white vaginal
discharge, while the surrounding skin covering the inside of
the thighs and buttocks may be very much reddened. The
baby should be taken at once to the physician at the first appearance
of these symptoms. Only rigid isolation can possibly prevent
other children from getting it&mdash;essentials are separate
towels, wash towels, soap (in the case of the older children),
and, in the case of the baby, separate diapers and rigid scrubbing
of the attendant's hands&mdash;in this way only can this infection
be held in check. The infected child should sleep by herself,
and utmost care must be exercised in preventing her fingers
from first touching the itching vulva and then placing them
to the eyes or to the mother's eyes. A vulva pad must be worn
as long as the disease lasts. The physician will give you the
proper medicines to be used in these cases, and if no physician
is within reach, you are perfectly safe in dropping into the
spread apart vulva a few drops of twenty-per-cent argyrol and
then applying the vulva pad. After each treatment the hands
of the mother or nurse must be most rigidly cleansed.</p>

<h4>ECZEMA</h4>

<p>Eczema is a very troublesome disease, particularly in infants;
there are so many forms of it that there is neither time nor
space in this volume to describe them individually. This dis<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">335</a></span>ease
may be produced in children by either internal or
external causes&mdash;from friction on the skin, from coarse, rough
woolen clothes, or from starched garments, or from lace or
starched bonnet strings which rub into the folds of the skin.
Irritating soap, the contact of soiled diapers, cheap toilet powders,
and discharges from the nose and ears may also be responsible
for the disease. The particular internal causes are over-feeding,
digestive disturbances, the too early use of starches
which create fermentation in the intestinal tract. In the most
frequent form of eczema the skin becomes red and then there
appear tiny vesicles (water blisters) which soon rupture and
"weep." This fluid which oozes from these tiny, ruptured
vesicles, in connection with the perspiration and exfoliation
of old skin, forms heavy crusts upon the face which are both
unsightly and annoying.</p>

<p>Another form of eczema is simply a very badly chafed condition
accompanied by intense itching, and commonly known
as "dry eczema." A very disagreeable form is the pustular
variety. One poor little sufferer that was once brought to us
had so many pustules on his head that one could not put a
ten cent piece on his scalp without touching a pustule. The
treatment of these cases, in order to be effective and leave the
child's head in normal condition, must be administered with
the utmost patience every day for weeks. A doctor's help is
always required in combating this sort of skin trouble. If
the cause is external, then the clothes should be changed. All
irritation should be removed&mdash;the clothing must not be allowed
to scratch the skin. The child must not scratch himself. If
necessary, little splints may be placed on the inside of his arms
to prevent his bending the elbows if the eczema is on the face,
while the little sleeves may be pinned to the side of the dress
to resist the movement of the arms.</p>

<h4>ECZEMA TREATMENT</h4>

<p>The diet should be most carefully looked into. The nursing
mother will earnestly look into every article of food she herself
is eating, and carefully avoid all foods that produce fermentation
or decomposition. The mother's urine should be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">336</a></span>
examined and its acidity noted; if it is above normal she
should take some alkalines such as ordinary baking soda or calcined
magnesia. If it is a bottle-fed baby, any form of flour
should be removed from the food and the quantity of the milk
reduced. All this, of course, is done under the direction of the
physician. Repeated doses of castor oil may be given.</p>

<p>The name of the medicinal agents that have been used in the
treatment of eczema, is legion. Perhaps one of the most widely
used is the early varnishing of the affected skin with ichthyol
(one part ichthyol, one part distilled water), which is swabbed
on after the skin has been cleansed with olive oil. Allow this
to almost dry, and then sprinkle on talcum powder which
smooths over the dry varnish of ichthyol. This is worn every
night and during the day, in bad cases, even when the eczema
is on the face. It is renewed each day, and is preceded by
the olive-oil bath. No water or soap is ever used in eczema.
Fortunately, the Eskimo has taught us that the skin really can
be cleansed with oil as well as with water. In the <a href="#APPENDIX">appendix</a>
will be found two prescriptions, number one and number two,
that have proved very beneficial in some of the most severe
forms of eczema.</p>

<h4>HIVES AND FRECKLES</h4>

<p>Hives, a crop of little raised red papules closely resembling
lesions caused by the sting of a mosquito, may make their
appearance upon the skin of the child, remain a few hours, and
then disappear. Hives are usually due to digestive disturbances
and may be caused by such foods as strawberries, nuts, pastries,
pineapple, certain sea foods, mushrooms, etc. A good
cathartic, the taking of alkalines, such as baking soda or calcined
magnesia, with a bran or starch bath, or possibly a soda
bath, will usually correct the difficulty. The same treatment
may be used in nettle rash or prickly heat.</p>

<p>Freckles seem to run in families. Broad-brimmed hats or
sunbonnets may be worn, but under no circumstance should a
little girl be bidden to remain in the house and shun the beautiful,
sunshiny outdoors just because she freckles easily. Do
not apply any lotions to the freckled face without medical<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">337</a></span>
advice, for great harm may be done the tender skin of the
child.</p>

<h4>RINGWORM</h4>

<p>Often upon the scalps of young children may be seen circles&mdash;rather,
patches&mdash;which are slightly rough to the touch, and
which cause the hair to fall out and the spots to remain bald.
They are known as ringworms of the scalp. The affection may
likewise appear on the body or the face, presenting a ring of
reddened skin with a scaly border. Ringworm on the scalp is
hard to treat and medical help should be secured, for, in spite
of all that can be done, the disease often runs its course, leaving
round bald spots over the head. Ringworm of the face, taken
early, is helped by carefully painting with tincture of iodine. The
mother should constantly bear in mind that ringworm is a
"catching" disease, so that all handkerchiefs, towels, and
clothes are to be kept separate. The disease known as mange
which so often attacks dogs, is nothing more than ringworm,
and children often contract the disease from dogs. Ringworm,
whether it be on children or dogs, may be greatly helped by
the use of tincture of iodine and other appropriate remedies.</p>

<h4>BOILS</h4>

<p>The much poulticing of boils has done an untold amount of
mischief. Many children and adults are in their graves today
because of improper treatment of boils. Blood poisoning which
so often follows the careless poulticing, as well as the uncleanly
opening of boils, can all be avoided. Before touching a boil,
the surrounding skin should be thoroughly washed with sterile
cotton and laundry soap and then disinfected with alcohol.
Then, with a scalpel or a surgeon's knife which has been either
boiled for twenty minutes or allowed to remain in pure carbolic
acid two minutes and then in alcohol two minutes, it should
be thoroughly opened down to the core so that the pus may
come out. It is very much better for the trained hands of a
physician to do this than for any member of the family to
undertake such an operation&mdash;where the danger of blood poisoning
is always present. The only treatment of skin eruptions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">338</a></span>
containing pus which is justifiable for the home folks to undertake
is to simply paint them with iodine. Under no circumstance
should poultices be used.</p>

<h4>FEVER BLISTERS</h4>

<p>It is not at all uncommon for small children to develop a
group of fever blisters on the lips when suffering with any
disease, or experiencing a high fever. Even a simple cold or
a spell of indigestion may be accompanied by fever blisters.
They appear not only on the lips but also on the edges of the
nose and may even be seen on the chin.</p>

<p>Early in their first appearance they may be treated with
spirits of camphor or plain alcohol, which sometimes tends to
abort them; but they usually run their course, and when they
are fully developed they may be treated with zinc oxide, simple
borated vaseline, or ichthyol.</p>

<h4>WARTS</h4>

<p>Very often children's hands are disfigured by warts. They
appear suddenly, develop rapidly, and many times disappear
just about as suddenly as they appeared. Every child suffering
from warts usually passes through the stage of charms
and lingoes which are popularly used to remove these disagreeable
growths. We hardly see any efficacy in "bean-ie, bean-ie
take this wart away," or any particular virtue in stealing
mother's dishcloth, cutting it up into as many pieces as there
are warts on the hand and rubbing each wart with a separate
piece of the cloth; but you will find people in every town or
village who will assure you that their warts were driven away
by one of these charms or lingoes. Warts are either better
left alone or removed by a physician with the high-frequency
spark or some other reliable method.</p>

<h4>BIRTHMARKS</h4>

<p>A red or purplish patch on the skin is the result, as mentioned
in an earlier chapter, of an embryological accident in
which one or more embryonic cells slipped out of place in the
early days of skin formation. These accidental markings may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">339</a></span>
occur on the face, the scalp, or on any other portion of the
body, and they should be let alone, unless they show a tendency
to grow, when it may prove best to give them proper surgical
attention.</p>

<p>A mole is also a birthmark, and if found upon the neck or
shoulders where it is likely to disfigure, it may be removed by
the high-frequency spark, or by surgery, in the same way as
warts. Never tamper with moles. Leave them alone or turn
them over to the surgeon.</p>

<h4>ERYSIPELAS</h4>

<p>Erysipelas is a much-dreaded disease which is the result of
infection with the blood-poisoning germ&mdash;streptococcus. It
usually occurs about a wound, and is due to infection by this
microbe. If it follows circumcision, it is due, of course, to
infection, and may be very serious, even causing death. It
attacks persons of any age and is oftenest seen on the face. In
appearance, the skin is a bright and shiny red, with a definite
line of demarcation slightly raised at the edges because of the
swollen tissues underneath. On pressure, the redness disappears
but reappears immediately upon relieving the pressure.
The inflammation, pain, and fever often continues a number of
days, during which the child should be isolated from all other
members of the family. The bowels should be freely opened,
and the diet should be liquid and soft; while local treatment is
cared for by the physician who should always be called. Should
erysipelas develop on a very young baby it is very important
that he should be removed at once from the mother. As stated
before, the disease is produced by the blood-poisoning germ
which is very much to be avoided in any and all stages of
obstetrics. One attack in no way renders the patients immune.
They may have repeated attacks of erysipelas. The treatments
should be started early and kept up most rigidly.</p>

<h4>SCABIES AND LICE</h4>

<p>In thickly settled districts among the poor and uneducated,
where filth and untidiness reign, the "itch" is a very prominent
disease. It is caused by the itch mite, a parasite which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">340</a></span>
burrows underneath the skin leaving behind its eggs in little
irregularly shaped, bluish tinted ridges. Such a profound
itching is set up by this burrowing and depositing of eggs that
the child cannot resist scratching, and all taken together produces
the typical itch-rash. The common site for this rash is
on the sides and between the fingers and toes; on arm pits and
buttocks of the child, as well as at the waistline. The treatment
is usually beyond home remedies. A physician should
have charge of the case who will conduct a line of treatment
which, if diligently followed, will rid the body of this scourge
within a week or ten days.</p>

<p>Along with the itch are often found parasites of the head,
or lice (pediculi). It is not at all infrequent to find them in
the heads of uncared for children; but if a much-cared-for
child is brought in contact with an infected head he will probably
"catch" the infection. A most intense and disagreeable
itching is set up at once. The treatment consists in getting
the head clean by the use of a very fine comb, thus endeavoring
to remove the adult parasites as well as the eggs or "nits."
However, great care should be taken to avoid injuring the
scalp. Perhaps the simplest and most effective treatment
known is the kerosene bath which should be applied at night,
the hair being done up in a bandage until morning, when the
kerosene is washed off with soap and water and then the hair
given a vigorous vinegar shampoo in order to destroy the
"nits." Tincture of larkspur, or an ointment made from the
seeds, may also be used. It is applied several days in succession
and then washed out.</p>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">341</a></span>
<h2>CHAPTER XXXIII</h2>
<h2>DEFORMITIES AND CHRONIC DISORDERS</h2>
</div>

<p>Reference has already been made to certain accidents
of embryology during the very early days or weeks of the
formative period of the embryo. Common illustrations of such
deforming developmental accidents are harelip, cleft palate,
and club foot.</p>

<h4>HARELIP AND CLEFT PALATE</h4>

<p>In the case of a partial or complete failure of the two sides
of the face to come together in the median line, a deformity
results which is known as harelip&mdash;a partial or complete cleft
of the upper lip. It may be a single or a double cleft, exposing
the teeth, or the cleft may even extend up into the nose.
This deformity may seriously interfere with nursing, making
it necessary to resort to feeding with a medicine dropper and
later a spoon. The success of the operation for the relief of
harelip, which should usually be performed during the early
months of life, is often very remarkable.</p>

<p>Should this failure to unite be in the deeper structures of
the head, then cleft palate is the result. This, too, may be partial
or complete: partial as seen in a cleft of the soft palate
only; and complete, when the hard palate also is involved. In
such an instance it is the floor of the nose that is defective;
hence the nose and mouth are one cavity.</p>

<p>A specially devised apparatus which assists the child in nursing
may be found on the market, for nursing is well-nigh
impossible without the closure of the roof of the mouth. The
operation for cleft palate is usually successful when performed
at the proper time and by competent hands.</p>

<p>In tongue-tie the weblike membrane underneath is attached<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">342</a></span>
too far forward, so that the child is quite unable to protrude
his tongue, and this condition greatly interferes with sucking.
The operation for the relief of this condition is slight, and
should be performed as soon as the defect is discovered.</p>

<h4>DEFORMED HANDS AND FEET</h4>

<p>Occasionally there is a webbing of one or more fingers of the
hand, and there are sometimes seen too many fingers or a double
thumb. It is needless to allow such a deformity to continue;
the operation for relief is often remarkably successful and
should be performed very early.</p>

<p>Clubfoot results when short tendons or contracted tendons
pull the toes inward or outward with raising of the heel. Treatment
must be instituted early; braces or splints are applied;
and untiring efforts are put forth in massage and other lines to
prevent a lifelong handicap of clubfoot.</p>

<p>An inward rotating of the legs presents the deformity of
pigeon-toe. The normal foot naturally inclines toward "pointing
in," and such a condition should not be discouraged. Many
flat feet (broken arch) are due to shoe lasts which compel
the toes to slant "out," and the bunions which so often follow
such mistreatment may be exceedingly painful.</p>

<p>By all means place shoes on the pigeon-toed child that possess
straight lasts with flexible arches, and which admit of the
exercise of many muscles of the foot which otherwise remain
inactive.</p>

<p>As the child grows older the toenails thicken, and often in
their trimming they are cut so closely at the corners that sometimes
a condition results known as ingrowing nails. Such are
very painful and must receive special attention. First of all,
the nail is cut squarely, and after scraping it thin the corner
is lifted and cotton so placed under it that the nail's downward
and inward growth is stopped.</p>

<h4>SPINAL CURVATURE</h4>

<p>Curvature of the spine is more common than is usually
thought. The most frequent variety of it is the lateral
curvature. One shoulder is lower than the other, and the hips<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">343</a></span>
are therefore uneven. Rickets, during infancy, is the most
common cause of spinal curvature.</p>

<p>Improper sitting at school&mdash;sitting on the edge of the seat&mdash;or
carrying heavy loads are often contributing factors to the
production of lateral curvatures. Only the muscles and ligaments
enter into this deformity, hence the treatment should
be started early and should consist of:</p>

<ol>
<li>Stretching exercises.</li>
<li>Hanging from the rounds of a ladder securely fastened to
the wall.</li>
<li>Certain applications of hot fomentations to the spinal muscles
for their relaxation.</li>
<li>Firm cushion placed under one or other of the hips to
encourage the re-establishment of muscular poise.</li>
<li>Special supervision of the case.</li>
</ol>

<h4>POTT'S DISEASE</h4>

<p>Pott's disease, or tuberculosis of the bone, often results in
an angular spinal deformity. This curvature, unlike the lateral
curvature, is a sequela of an actual disease of the bones. It is
always very serious and demands early treatment from skilled
hands. Early in the disease there is a peculiar stiff, tottering
gait. The little child holds the spine rigidly, and in picking up
objects from the floor bends the knees instead of the spine. If
the trouble is in the upper spine, the shoulders are held high
and the head is stiffly poised, it is never rotated; in looking
about the entire body turns.</p>

<p>Medical aid should be secured early. The X ray not only
locates the difficulty but also determines the extent of the
process. If the spine be put to perfect rest, outdoor life begun,
a diet rich in fats established, the results are often wonderfully
successful.</p>

<p>Another tubercular condition is seen in the much dreaded
hip-joint disease which parents should always be on the lookout
for. The earliest symptoms are crying out in the night
suddenly, unnatural standing on one leg (to relieve the strain
on the diseased hip) and so-called "growing pains." Call in
a physician very early and institute proper treatment. A pos<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">344</a></span>terior
curvature of the spine is often associated with a bad
case of rickets. It is of temporary duration, and usually clears
up when the symptoms of rickets have been eradicated. It
involves only the back muscles&mdash;not the vertebral bones.</p>

<p>The young mother is often very much concerned over the
misshapen head of the child as a result of a prolonged labor;
and it does seem quite miraculous to see a head, more nearly
resembling an egg than anything else, become beautifully
round and shapely by the end of two or three days.</p>

<p>Protruding ears may be encouraged to lie more flatly by the
wearing of a specialized bonnet at night. When the babies are
too young to turn themselves they should be turned first to one
side and then the other, while care should always be exercised
in properly straightening out a curled under ear or an overlapping
ear.</p>

<h4>RHEUMATISM</h4>

<p>While we so often regard rheumatism an adult disease, nevertheless,
children do suffer its aches and pains as well as the
fever which so often attends the inflammatory type. The so-called
"growing pains" are often of rheumatic origin.</p>

<p>Diseased tonsils not only are often&mdash;very often&mdash;the avenue
of entry of infectious microorganisms that cause one type
of rheumatism, but many forms of valvular heart disease are
also directly traceable to these same diseased tonsils. The
treatment consists in giving proper attention to the tonsils,
even removal if necessary&mdash;and if the child is old enough. All
other possible causes should be located and removed; the child
should have absolute rest in bed with brisk cathartics and a
liquid diet (no meat broths). The diet should consist more
of alkalinizing foods as shown in the special table in the appendix.
Medicinal alkalines are often given when the urine shows
a very high acid reaction.</p>

<h4>SCURVY</h4>

<p>Scurvy, seen in children who subsist on "prepared foods,"
is manifested by tender legs and swollen gums which have a
tendency to bleed easily. Pallor, loss of appetite, and insomnia<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">345</a></span>
accompany the condition. The treatment of scurvy is change
of diet from "patent foods" to fresh cow's milk, with the
addition of orange juice, daily. In older children the food must
be very nutritious; out of door life, salt glows, friction baths
(see <a href="#APPENDIX">appendix</a>), and the taking of large amounts of fats are
all essential to the cure.</p>

<h4>ADENITIS&mdash;ENLARGED GLANDS</h4>

<p>Enlarged glands, or what our grandmothers used to call
"kernels" in the throat are often the result of inflammation in
the mouth or throat, and occur in connection with many of
the childhood diseases, notably diphtheria, scarlet fever, and
scarlatina.</p>

<p>Glands appearing in the back of the neck may be occasioned
by pediculli (lice), ring worm, or eczema, while those seen in
the neck just back and below the ears may come from mastoiditis
(inflammation of the middle ear) or adenoids.</p>

<p>Glands felt under the arm enlarge because of trouble or
infection in the breast, hand, or arm; while glands in the groin
are usually due to some infection of the feet, legs, or abdomen.</p>

<p>These glands usually disappear when the general health and
well-being of the child is improved by:</p>

<ol>
<li>Outdoor life.</li>
<li>Morning dry-friction rub to the skin.</li>
<li>Good liberal diet, including plenty of fats.</li>
<li>No feeding between meals.</li>
<li>The salt glow and general tonic treatment (see <a href="#APPENDIX">appendix</a>).</li>
<li>The oil rub at night.</li>
</ol>

<h4>RICKETS</h4>

<p>Rickets (a disease of the bones) often follows in the wake
of faulty feeding and unhygienic surroundings. The bones
lack a proper amount of lime salts and other elements. Development
in general, especially that of the bones, is greatly interfered
with.</p>

<p>Bowlegs, prominent square brow, enlarged perspiring head,
weakness, and often tenderness of the flesh, are notable
signs of the disease. The treatment varies little from that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">346</a></span>
of scurvy, and will be provided in detail by the attending
physician.</p>

<h4>MALARIA</h4>

<p>Children often suffer from malarial parasites. Sudden rise
of fever on regular days (sometimes daily, every two days or
every three days) should demand a careful medical examination
including the examination of the blood where the offending
organism is seen in the red blood cells. We recently saw
a little girl who happened to have an earache and was about
to be operated on for ear trouble, when examination of the
blood revealed the fact that she was suffering from malaria.</p>

<h4>TUBERCULOSIS</h4>

<p>In the routine examination of adult patients, the X ray
observations of the lungs often reveal deposits of lime salts
which tell the story of a successful fight against tuberculosis
(<a href="#illus-018">Fig. 16</a>). And while it may seem surprising, we believe
beyond a doubt that most of us have had some varying degree
of tuberculosis while young&mdash;the unrecognized battle has
been fought&mdash;and these small monuments of lime salts alone
remain to tell the interesting story.</p>

<p>The pity of it is that whole armies of little folks fall in this
struggle against disease, for it is one of the common and fatal
diseases of childhood. Fresh-air schools, playgrounds, and
free school lunches are saving hundreds of children from
the ravages of this disease each year.</p>

<p>Tuberculosis is strictly a house disease, hence the little
tubercular patient must seek outdoor life. All avoidable exposure
to the disease must be denounced, and public sentiment
must continue to be aroused to the hygienic betterment of the
tenement districts and basement homes. The sanitary drinking
cup and the bubble fountain must be encouraged, as must also
the proper ventilation of all places where crowds assemble, be
it the schoolroom, the theater, or the church.</p>

<span class="caption">Fig. 16. X ray Showing Tuberculosis of the Lung.</span>
</div>

<h4>SYPHILIS</h4>

<p>While tuberculosis is known as the "great white plague,"
syphilis and gonorrhea constitute the "great black plague,"
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">347</a></span>which seen in the little folks is pitiable indeed, leading us to
realize that surely "the children's teeth have been set on
edge" because of the careless eating of sour grapes by the
parents. Syphilitic parents who have not been properly treated,
should think many times before they take upon themselves the
awful responsibility of bringing into the world a tainted child.
Proper mercurial treatment should be instituted at once not
only for the child but also in the case of both parents.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIV</h2>
<h2>ACCIDENTS AND EMERGENCIES</h2>
</div>

<p>In this chapter we wish to instruct the mother or the caretaker
in doing the one thing needful for every one of the
more common household accidents and emergencies while waiting
for the doctor.</p>

<p>In every household there should be found an accident and
emergency "kit" of necessary paraphernalia for the quick
application of the one necessary medicine, dressing, etc. This
"kit" should contain baking soda for burns, bandages and
sterile gauze for cuts or tears, together with adhesive plaster,
needle and thread, etc.</p>

<h4>INSECT BITES AND STINGS</h4>

<p>Far greater harm is often done the skin by the subsequent
scratching of the insect bite with dirty finger nails than by the
bite <ins class="typo" title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'iself'">itself</ins>; and so it is very important that we remember to
allay quickly the intense itching by the application of ammonia,
water or camphor. Almost instantly the itching is stopped,
and the added "scratching" irritation to the already injured
skin is thus avoided.</p>

<p>By the aid of a magnifying glass, and often by the naked
eye, we may detect the stinger which has been left behind by
the greedy guest, and which should be removed by a pair of
tweezers. Ice-water compresses will stop the swelling and even
an old-fashioned mud dressing, which was used and appreciated
by our great grandmothers, is a thing not to be despised.</p>

<p>If the much admired shrubbery be removed one hundred feet
away from the porch, mosquitoes would trouble the household
less. It has been demonstrated in many localities that clearing
away the near-by clumps of shrubbery permits the family to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">349</a></span>
sit on unscreened porches unharmed. Mosquitoes multiply
rapidly in stagnant pools of water, but if oil is poured over
these stagnant waters the increase of mosquitoes is abated, and
their total extinction is not unheard of in swampy districts
receiving such care.</p>

<p>Whenever baby is out of doors where mosquitoes, flies, or
other insects are to be found, he should be properly protected
from such pests by mosquito netting stretched over a frame
eighteen inches above his face, for we can think of nothing
more uncomfortable than a mosquito netting dragging over a
sweaty baby's face. The fact that mosquitoes, flies, roaches,
and other insects are carriers of tuberculosis, infantile paralysis,
typhoid fever, cholera, yellow fever and malaria, as well
as a host of minor ailments, should make us the more anxious
for either their extermination or the protection of our children
from their greedy bites and stings.</p>

<h4>DOG BITES AND SNAKE BITES</h4>

<p>Dogs, cats, rats, or mice bite at any time of the year, and
provision should always be made for ample protection against
such accidents.</p>

<p>Such a wound should always be squeezed or sucked until it
has bled freely, and then be cauterized by a red-hot iron or
touched with an applicator that has been dipped in sulphuric
acid or nitric acid. A subsequent dressing of Balsam Peru is
healing. The dog should be watched, and if it shows signs of
hydrophobia the bitten child should be promptly taken to the
nearest Pasteur Institute for treatment.</p>

<p>In the case of snake bites the same sucking and cauterizing
treatment is indicated, with the additional tying of a handkerchief
or cord a few inches above the wound to stay the progress
of the blood and to keep the poison out of the general
circulation. A solution of twenty-per-cent permanganate of
potash should be used to wash the wound.</p>

<p>The popular administration of large draughts of whiskey is
of no benefit, for the secondary depressant effect of alcohol
increases the body's poison burden, and those who survive do
so in spite of the whiskey, and not because of it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">350</a></span></p>

<h4>SWALLOWING FOREIGN BODIES</h4>

<p>Small articles such as buttons, safety pins, thimbles, coins,
etc., are often swallowed by little folks, and if they lodge in
the throat and the child struggles for his breath the treatment
is as follows: grasp him by the heels and turn him upside
down while a helper briskly slaps him on the back. The foreign
body generally flies across the room. If it is lodged high
up in the throat it may often be dislodged by the thumb and
finger. If it cannot be reached and it will not go down, lose
no time in seeking an X-ray laboratory where its exact location
may quickly be discovered and proper measures instituted
for its removal.</p>

<p>A troublesome fish bone is easily dislodged by swallowing
a half-chewed piece of bread which carries it down to the
stomach. Cathartics and purgatives are not to be given; in due
time the object will appear in the stool. In all instances it is well
to locate its exact position by the X ray&mdash;that there may be
assurance that it will do no harm.</p>

<p>It is surprising what large objects can be swallowed. One
old gentleman swallowed his false teeth, and a six months old
baby swallowed, or at least had lodged in its throat, a silver
dollar.</p>

<p>All detachable parts should be removed from toys that are
given to babies, such as the whistle from rubber animals, the
button eyes of wool kittens and dogs, and other such removable
parts.</p>

<h4>FOREIGN BODIES IN THE EYE</h4>

<p>To begin with, do not get "panicky," but carefully, painstakingly,
and patiently do the following:</p>

<p>1. Rub the well eye until the tears flow plentifully in both
eyes.</p>

<p>2. Blow the nose on the injured eye side, closing the other
side. This often encourages the tears to wash the foreign
speck down through the tear duct, into the nose and out into
the handkerchief (in case the child is old enough to follow such
instruction). If the foreign body be sharp, as a piece of steel
or flint is likely to be, it may be driven right into the eyeball.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">351</a></span>
Seek a physician who will drop medicine into the eye to deaden
the pain and then if it cannot be gently rubbed off the eyeball,
a magnet will promptly remove it.</p>

<p>An eye bath of warm boracic acid is always comforting
and never does harm, so that may be given while waiting for
the doctor to come, if the object seems to be beyond the reach
of family help.</p>

<p>If an alkaline, such as lime, be blown into the eye it is very
painful, but much relief may be obtained by gently pouring
into the eye, by means of a medicine dropper or eye cup, warm
water to which has been added a little vinegar or lemon juice.
Likewise, acid in the eye produces much pain. In this instance,
an eye bath of a weak soda solution is indicated.</p>

<h4>FOREIGN BODIES IN EAR AND NOSE</h4>

<p>Insects that have crawled into the ear may be suffocated by
dropping sweet oil or castor oil into the ear, which, after twenty
minutes, should be washed out by gentle syringing with warm
water from a fountain syringe, hung one foot above the child's
head.</p>

<p>Peas, beans, shoe buttons, or beads are sometimes put into
the ear and nose by adventurous or experimenting children.</p>

<p>The shoe button or bead will not swell as does the pea or the
bean, and may often be safely washed out. If it is causing
no pain and will not drop out in case of the ear, or will not be
easily blown out in case of the nose, see your physician at once.
He has in his possession just the necessary instruments for
its immediate removal.</p>

<p>Peas and beans swell, and consequently cause greater discomfort
the longer they are in; do not poke at any foreign
body lodged either in the nose or the ear, for the ear drum may
thus be injured, while in the former case it may be pushed
into one of the accessory sinuses.</p>

<h4>EARACHE</h4>

<p>One of the most comforting and highly effectual forms of
heat for an aching ear is a four-candle-power carbon electric
light on an extension cord that permits the light to come in close<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">352</a></span>
contact with the ear. A shade is made from a piece of stiff
letter paper that fits the socket snugly and flares out to a three
inch opening, which should extend below the point of the bulb
one inch. This shade holds all the heat and light and directs it
into the aching ear.</p>

<p>In every well-ordered household there will be found a
three-per-cent solution of carbolic acid and glycerine of
which one drop should be put into the aching ear, and then the
external heat, mentioned above, should be applied. A bag of
warm salt, a hot water bag, or a warm plate will provide external
heat if an electric light is not available. Do not put laudanum
or other remedies into the ear, other than are herein suggested,
without your physician's knowledge.</p>

<p>Earache is always serious, and since it is usually indicative
of trouble which, if left untreated, may cause deafness, it
demands thorough treatment from skilled hands.</p>

<p>Running ears invariably need medical attention and should
never be neglected.</p>

<h4>NOSEBLEED</h4>

<p>If the nose bleeds whenever it is cleansed, more than likely
there is an ulcer on the septum which will continue to bleed if
left untreated. The physician should heal the ulcer, and the
child should be taught always to vaseline the nostril before
cleansing it.</p>

<p>In case of persistent nosebleed, put the child to bed with the
head elevated. Pressure should be put on the blood vessels
going to the nose by placing two fingers firmly on the outer
angles of the nose on the upper lip, while a helper may put
firm pressure at the root of the nose at the inner angle of each
eye. An ice bag may be placed at the back of the neck, and
another piece of ice held on the forehead at the root of the
nose. If these measures do not stop the flow of blood a few
drops of adrenalin may be put into the nose and repeated in
five minutes if necessary. As the bleeding begins to stop, as
well as during the bleeding, all blowing of the nose is forbidden
as it will only cause the bleeding to start afresh. It sometimes
helps to hold a piece of ice in the hands.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">353</a></span></p>

<h4>CUTS AND TEARS</h4>

<p>A cut with smooth edges, if deep, should be allowed to bleed
freely, should be washed in boracic acid solution, and its edges
held together by a stitch which is usually put in by a physician;
but if treatment is to be given at home, the hands of the nurse
must be thoroughly washed and the thread and needle boiled
for twenty minutes. If the physician has been sent for, make
firm pressure over the wound by bandaging tightly with a
dressing of sterile gauze dipped in boracic acid solution.</p>

<p>In case of a slight cut, make it bleed freely, then wash in
boracic-acid solution and apply sterile gauze held in place by
a binder. If no odor or pain follows, let alone for two or
three days, when a new dressing is applied.</p>

<p>A physician should be called in case of ragged wounds or
tears, as such usually leave bad scars. Cleanse carefully, leaving
no dirt in the wound, cause it to bleed, if possible, and apply
a sterile gauze compress wet in boracic-acid solution, bandaged
on as directed above. Zinc ointment may be applied to surfaces
that have been skinned. All dressings on dirty wounds
should be changed daily.</p>

<p>Blood poisoning may readily follow a wound, hence the utmost
cleanliness should prevail. The hands of the attendant, the
dressings, the surrounding skin, must all be clean. The bowels
should be kept open, and under-feeding rather than over-feeding
is indicated.</p>

<p>If a needle be needed to open a sore or boil, always disinfect
the part and surrounding area by painting with tincture of
iodine, and heat the needle to red heat through a flame before
it touches the sore.</p>

<p>In case of cuts or wounds of the eyeball apply a compress
of sterile gauze wet in boracic acid, held on by a bandage, and
go immediately to a good eye specialist.</p>

<h4>PUNCTURED WOUNDS AND SLIVERS</h4>

<p>Wounds made by pins, needles, fishhooks, tacks, and splinters
are always very painful and great care must be exercised to
force bleeding freely, which helps to wash out infection, as<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">354</a></span>
more than likely microbes entered with the instrument or
sliver when the wound was made.</p>

<p>Fishhooks are exceedingly troublesome, as they often occasion
the enlarging of the wound to get them out, especially if
they have gone in beyond the barb.</p>

<p>Slivers are easily broken off, so great care is needed in their
removal. A pair of tweezers is convenient for seizing the
protruding portion, while all side movements are avoided lest
it break off in the flesh, in which case it may be gotten out
with a needle that has been sterilized in a flame.</p>

<p>All puncture wounds should be dressed with the wet, sterile
compress, covered over with wax paper and bandaged loosely;
this encourages cleanliness and favors healing.</p>

<h4>BRUISES</h4>

<p>If left untreated, bruises swell, become highly discolored,
and in the process of healing pass through the dark blue, green,
and yellow stages. The treatment is as follows: Apply hot and
cold alternately&mdash;the heat should be as hot as can be borne
and left on very hot for three minutes, then ice water compresses
should be applied for one minute, then hot again&mdash;these
changes should continue for an hour, and if carried out immediately
after the injury all discolorations and most of the swelling
may be avoided. Witch-hazel compresses are comforting.
If discoloration has taken place, the application of hot compresses
will often hasten its disappearance.</p>

<h4>FRACTURES AND DISLOCATIONS</h4>

<p>While there is very little a member of the family or a non-medical
friend can do in case of a fracture, and while it is
unwise to offer suggestions relative to the setting of bones, yet
it is highly important that both the family and friends know
how properly to support a broken leg while carrying a disabled
person into the house or to near-by medical aid.</p>

<p>For instance, in the case of a fractured leg below the knee,
if a couple of flat boards three inches wide be tied about the
leg with two pocket handkerchiefs, the ends of the fractured
bone will not rub against each other and the pain will be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">355</a></span>
much less in carrying. In this way all danger of causing the
broken bones to protrude and thus "compounding" the fracture
is also avoided. And also, if there is no near-by ambulance,
a good emergency stretcher may be improvised out of two or
three buttoned vests with two poles, rakes, or brooms run
through the armholes&mdash;one vest under the shoulders and one
under the hips and still another under the fracture. An injured
person may in this way be carried for miles quite comfortably.</p>

<p>Two people may fashion a seat out of their four hands on
which the disabled child may sit with his arms about the necks
of his two friends. If the fractured end of the bone penetrates
the flesh it is then known as a compound fracture and the
utmost cleanliness must prevail&mdash;as in dressing other wounds.
An X ray laboratory should always be sought, where convenient,
to ascertain if the ends of the bones are in good
position.</p>

<p>In dislocations, the bone has slipped out of place at the joint.
Medical aid should be called to replace the bone, while hot
applications may be used in the meantime.</p>

<h4>SPRAINS</h4>

<p>All sprains (a twist or straining of a joint) should promptly
be put into a very hot bath and held there for thirty minutes.
If this is impossible, then a rubber tube or a handkerchief is
tied snugly between the sprain and the trunk of the body. Almost
instantly the pain, which is often intense and severe, is very much
lessened. The hot-water bath is very hot, and the joint should be
very red on taking it out. Immediately following the bath the
injured joint is wrapped in a very cold wet compress, which
is next completely covered by silk, gutta-percha, mackintosh,
or many thicknesses of newspaper&mdash;anything that will hold
all the heat in&mdash;as the cold compress is quickly heated up.
Lastly, a bandage of heavy flannel completely covers the whole&mdash;compress,
impervious covering, etc.</p>

<p>The joint is now elevated for three hours, when it is again
immersed in a very hot bath and then again the cold compress
is applied. This is continued every three hours, except during
sleep, for two days, after which it may be done morning and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">356</a></span>
evening. Massage is now administered every three hours, first
four inches below the injury then four inches above it, while
in a day or so the joint itself may be gently rubbed with well-oiled
hands. By the end of one week the patient begins to use
the injured member.</p>

<p>In the case of a sprained ankle a properly applied adhesive
strap bandage will give no end of relief and support. Various
liniments may be applied, but usually the good obtained is from
the thorough rubbing which always accompanies their use
according to directions.</p>

<p>Sprains treated as above directed will often liberate the
child in one-third the usual time generally allotted for its
healing.</p>

<h4>FROST BITES AND CHILBLAINS</h4>

<p>Keep the child who has frozen some part of his body in a
cool room, and rub the frost-bitten part with snow or ice water,
or wrap it up in cold water compresses.</p>

<p>The return to heat must be slow indeed, else much pain may
be experienced; blisters followed by discoloration, and even
mortification, may set in. You may be surprised some morning
on awakening to find your child's hand twice its normal size
and very red, because it was out from under the cover a good
share of the night exposed to Jack Frost. Do not bring it to
heat quickly but immerse it in cold water, gradually and slowly
raising the temperature of the bath until it is warm and comfortable.</p>

<p>The intense itching and burning of a chilblain may often be
relieved by painting with iodine or triple chloride of iron (Monsel's
solution). Soap liniment has also been suggested, as
well as alternate applications of hot and cold water. Chilblains
are troublesome, painful, and their yearly recurrence is often
very annoying.</p>

<h4>SWALLOWING POISONS</h4>

<p>Poisons of an acid nature, such as hydrochloric, sulphuric,
nitric, or oxalic acids, are neutralized by alkalines, such as
magnesia, chalk, soda, and soap, followed by soothing drinks
or sweet oil.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">357</a></span></p>

<p>Remember that carbolic acid is not an acid, and is not antidoted
with alkalines. The swallowing of carbolic acid should
be quickly followed by diluted alcohol, and if this drug is not
ready at hand many of the numerous alcoholic patent medicines
will do just as well. Epsom salts should be given in abundance.</p>

<p>Poisons of an alkaline nature, such as lye, washing soda,
ammonia, etc., are antidoted with vinegar or lemon juice, followed
by soothing drinks or sweet oil.</p>

<p>A complete table of poisons and their antidotes will be found
in the <a href="#APPENDIX">appendix</a>.</p>

<p>Poison ivy, as soon as detected, should be treated as follows:
Thoroughly scrub the affected part with tincture of green
soap and hot water, which often prevents the trouble developing.
Clean pieces of gauze may be wrung out of lime water
and placed over the inflamed and much swollen surface, keeping
them very wet. At night an ointment of zinc oxide may be
applied over a painting of "black wash" (to be obtained at
drug stores). Poison (trifoliolate, or <i>three-leaved</i>) ivy resembles
Virginia Creeper, and all nurses and caretakers should
be able to recognize it.</p>

<p>Another treatment for poison ivy which is said to be very
efficient is as follows: Moisten a bit of cotton with a ten-percent
solution of carbolic acid and apply to the affected area&mdash;then
immediately (about one-half minute) wipe off this carbolic
acid with another piece of cotton saturated with alcohol.</p>

<p>Matches, roach powders, fly poisons, washing fluids, lye, paris
green, antiseptic tablets, and pieces of green paper, should all
be kept out of the child's reach; and, in case of accidental
swallowing of any of them, the physician should be sent for at
once, and with the message "Come!" should be given the name
of the poison swallowed&mdash;if it is known.</p>

<p>After the antidote is given, soothing drinks are usually administered,
such as raw white of egg, milk, flaxseed tea, slippery
elm, etc.</p>

<p>Complete rest in bed is always essential, and external heat is
necessary for the body chills easily as the child grows weak.</p>

<p>Toothache may be temporarily relieved by applying an ice
bag below the jaw, thus diminishing the flow of blood to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">358</a></span>
tooth, and a hot-water bottle to the cheek, which causes the skin
vessels to fill with blood, thus relieving the tension in the
vessels of the tooth.</p>

<p>If there is a cavity, a small piece of cotton moistened with
oil of cloves and packed well into it may give much relief.</p>

<p>Children and adults should make a bi-annual pilgrimage to
the dentist, who seeks out beginning cavities, early treatment
of which will prevent these dreadful aches and later ill health.</p>

<h4>BURNS</h4>

<p>Burns and scalds are not at all uncommon with children, whose
eagerness to explore and desire to investigate often leads them
into trouble.</p>

<p>1. The simple reddening of the skin&mdash;slight burns and sunburn&mdash;simply
needs protecting oil, or equal parts of oil and
lime water, and is to be covered with sterile gauze.</p>

<p>2. The burns which destroy the outer layer of the skin, producing
a blister, are treated much as a wound would be treated.
The blister, if larger than a half dollar, should be opened near
the edge with a needle which has been passed through a flame.
The serum should be pressed out and the parts protected by
a piece of gutta-percha that has been disinfected with some
antiseptic solution; this covering keeps the dressings from sticking,
thus avoiding the destruction of the new-forming tissues.</p>

<p>3. When the tissues are injured in the more severe burns,
the surrounding flesh is carefully disinfected with boracic-acid
solution, and the same dressing applied as described for the
"blister burns." Balsam Peru is a healing balm for burns of
this classification.</p>

<p>If a child's clothes catch on fire he is instantly to be thrown
on the floor and any heavy woolen fabric, such as a curtain,
table spread, blanket, or rug, is to be thrown over him (beginning
at the neck) and the flames thus smothered. The clothing
is now cut off, and if more than one-third of the body is burned
the child should be taken to the hospital for constant care;
and if more than one-half of the body is injured recovery is
doubtful. Great care should be taken in keeping the unburned
portion of the body warm, as there is a great tendency for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">359</a></span>
child to become very cold as he weakens from both the nervous
shock and from the absorption of toxins.</p>

<p>Acid chemical burns are treated with baking soda, except
in the case of carbolic acid (misnamed), which is treated with
alcohol; alkaline chemical burns are dressed in vinegar or lemon
juice compresses.</p>

<p>Methods for restoring the drowned should be understood by
every man, woman, and youth. These methods are more fully
taken up in works devoted to emergencies and will not be discussed
in detail at this time.</p>

<h4>FAINTING</h4>

<p>Consciousness is quickly restored to the fainting child by
lowering the head&mdash;laying him flat on the floor&mdash;while an
assistant raises the legs perpendicularly. Cold dashes of water
may be slapped on the chest with a towel, while the face is
bathed or sprinkled with cold water. Consciousness is usually
quickly restored by the above suggestions, in connection with
plenty of fresh air.</p>

<p>A sudden blow on the head occasionally results in a severe
condition known as concussion of the brain. There is a partial
or complete loss of consciousness lasting from a few moments
to an hour or two. Pallor of the skin and a sense of bewilderment
accompany concussion of the brain.</p>

<p>Rest, quiet, and darkness should prevail until the physician
arrives and makes an examination. External heat to the
extremities may be applied, but no stimulants are to be administered
until so ordered by the physician.</p>

<p>It is wise to seek medical advice in the case of odd or unusual
behavior after a fall on the head.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXV</h2>
<h2>DIET AND NUTRITION</h2>
</div>

<p>Most interesting is the study of the food as it passes
through the processes of digestion, absorption, assimilation,
and oxidation&mdash;all definite and important parts of the
great cycle through which everything we eat passes on its way
from the table to the tissues. Elimination is the last step in
nutrition, and is the process by which the body rids itself of the
broken down cells and other poisonous and useless wastes.
These various phases of bodily nutrition may be expressed in
a single term&mdash;metabolism.</p>

<p>What we eat and how much we eat must be carefully planned,
for our body temple is really made of what we eat. If you
were erecting a beautiful mansion you would not think of
allowing cheap, trashy, and inferior building materials to enter
into the construction of your home. Neither should you permit
unfit and inferior materials to become a part of the daily dietary
of your little boy or girl, thus to become a part of their bodily
structure.</p>

<h4>ASSIMILATION OF FOOD</h4>

<p>Following the process of digestion in the stomach and intestine,
the nutritive food elements are absorbed through the wall
of the bowel by the wonderfully adapted little villus, and distributed
by various routes to the uttermost parts of the body.
The sugars (all starches are changed into sugar) are carried
in the portal blood stream to the liver, where they are actually
stored away in the form of glycogen which, in a most intelligent
manner, is dealt out to the body from hour to hour as it is
needed for fuel. If all the sugar, after a hearty meal, were
poured into the circulation at once, the blood stream would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">361</a></span>
be overwhelmed and the kidneys would be forced to excrete
it in the urine. This unnecessary waste is avoided by the liver's
storing sugar after each meal and dealing it out to the body as
required.</p>

<p>Likewise, the proteins also pass through the liver on their
way to the body. Just what action the liver exerts upon proteins
is not wholly known at the present writing. The digested
fats are absorbed at once by the lacteals, the beginning of
the intestinal lymphatic system, by which they are carried to the
large veins at the root of the neck and there emptied into the
blood stream. We have now traced our various food elements
through the processes of digestion and absorption in the alimentary
tract, some going through the liver, and others through
the lymphatic system, until they circulate in the blood stream
itself.</p>

<p>It is from these food substances, circulating in the blood
stream, that the various cells of the body must assimilate into
themselves such portions as they require for purposes of heat
and energy and for the repair of their cell substance. This
specialized work of cell assimilation converts the dissolved
watery food in the blood into solid tissues, exactly reversing
the process of digestion.</p>

<p>With a most profound intelligence, each of these body cells
and tissues, bone and nerve fiber, muscle and organ, selects
from the blood stream just its supply or portion of the food
elements requisite to its upbuilding and maintenance. The
mysteries of assimilation are effected by means of chemical substances
called "enzymes," similar to those found in the digestive
organs, but acting in an entirely different manner, in that
they build up solids out of liquids instead of converting solids
into liquids.</p>

<h4>ELIMINATION OF BODY WASTES</h4>

<p>Metabolism consists of a twofold r&ocirc;le&mdash;an upbuilding and a
tearing down process. After the food is all digested, absorbed,
and assimilated, having become a part of the bodily organ, bone,
muscle, and nerve fiber, then begins the work of tearing it down&mdash;of
liberating its heat and energy&mdash;to be followed by its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">362</a></span>
elimination from the body through the sweat glands, uriniferous
tubules of the kidneys, etc. The carbohydrates (starches and
sugars), together with the fats, are completely burned up in
the body and are then eliminated in the form of water (thrown
off through the sweat) and carbonic acid gas given up by the
lungs.</p>

<p>The proteins, or nitrogenous foods, are not so completely
burned up in the body. The ashes which result from their combustion
are not simple substances like the water and CO<sub>2</sub> of
the carbohydrates. This protein ash is represented by a number
of complicated substances, some of which are solid (protein
clinkers), which accumulate in the body and help to bring about
many diseases, such as gout, headache, fatigue, biliousness,
etc.</p>

<p>These protein ashes and clinkers are further acted upon&mdash;split
up and sifted&mdash;by the liver, and are finally eliminated
by the kidneys in the form of urea, uric acid, etc. The body
being unable to store up protein, is often greatly embarrassed
when one eats more of this substance than is daily required
to replenish the waste of the body, for it must all be immediately
split up in the system, and the over-abundant and irritating
ashes must be carried off by the eliminating organs. Now,
the overeating of sugars, starches, or fats, is not such a serious
matter, as they may be stored in the liver and subsequently
used; and even if they are eaten in excess of what the liver
can care for they accumulate as fat or add extra fuel to the
fires of the body, their ashes being carried off in the form of
such harmless substances as water and carbon <ins class="typo" title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'dioxid'">dioxide</ins> (CO<sub>2</sub>);
but the overeating of protein substances is always a strain on
the body and should be avoided.</p>

<h4>ELEMENTS OF NUTRITION</h4>

<p>There are seven distinct elements entering into the composition
of human foods&mdash;protein, starch, sugar, fat, salts, cellulose,
and water, not to mention enzymes, vitamines, and other
little-known chemical principles. These elements are all variously
concerned in the nourishment, energizing, and warming
of the body.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">363</a></span></p>

<h4>PROTEINS</h4>

<p>The proteins are the structure builders of the body. While
starches, fats, and sugars may be compared to the coal that
feeds the locomotive, the proteins represent the iron and steel
that are used from time to time to repair the engine and replace
its worn parts. The essential chemical difference between starch
and protein is that the latter contains nitrogen and a small
amount of sulphur and phosphorus. The most common forms
in which protein is used for food are the glutens of the grains,
the legumes, nuts, cheese, the white of egg, and lean meat.</p>

<h4>STARCHES</h4>

<p>The starches are by far the most abundant of all elements
in human food. They enter largely into the composition of
nearly all plants and seeds. Under the influence of the sunlight,
the green-colored plants gather up the CO<sub>2</sub> of the air
and, with the water absorbed from the ground, build up starch.
The plant takes all the carbon from which starch is made from
the air, but while the atmosphere contains almost eighty per
cent of nitrogen, the plant is unable to use it; it must secure
its nitrogen from the decaying refuse of the soil. Thus the
plant utilizes the waste products found in air and earth in the
building of its food substances.</p>

<p>Starch exists in the form of small granules. Since each little
starch granule is surrounded by a woody envelope of cellulose,
it becomes necessary to cook all starches thoroughly in order
to burst this cellulose envelope and thus enable the saliva to
begin, and other secretions to continue, the work of digestion.</p>

<h4>FRUIT SUGARS</h4>

<p>The sugar of fruits represents a form of food requiring practically
no digestion; while the sugar found in beets, the cane
plant, and the maple tree, must be acted upon by the digestive
juices of the intestine before their absorption can take place.
During the winter, the maple tree stores its carbohydrates in
its roots in the form of starch. With the advent of spring
Mother Nature begins the digestion of this starch&mdash;actually
turns it into sugar&mdash;and in the form of the sweet sap it finds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">364</a></span>
its way up into the tree trunk to be deposited in the leaves and
bark in the form of cellulose, a process very similar to that
performed by digestion in the human body, where starch by
digestion is first turned into sugar, and afterwards deposited
in another form in the liver and muscles.</p>

<p>Dextrine is a form of sugar resulting from thoroughly cooking
or partially digesting starch. There are about twenty-five stages
or forms of dextrine between raw starch and digested starch or
fruit sugar. Dextrine is found in the brown-colored portions of
well-toasted bread.</p>

<h4>FATS</h4>

<p>Fat is a combination of glycerine and certain fatty acids.
As a food, it is derived from both the animal and the vegetable
kingdom. Animal fat consists of lard, suet, fat meat, etc., while
fat of animal origin is represented by cream, butter, and the
yolks of eggs. The vegetable fats are found in nuts, especially
the pecan, cocoanut, Brazil, and pine nuts; also in the grains,
particularly oats and corn. The peanut also contains a considerable
amount of fat. Of the fruits, the banana and strawberry
contain a trace of fat, while the olive is the only fruit
rich in fat.</p>

<p>As a food, fat is used in three forms. The emulsified form
is represented by cream, olive oil, and nuts. When the tiny
globules of fat, which are each surrounded by a little film of
casein, are crushed&mdash;united into a solid mass&mdash;we have a
free fat. This form is represented by butter and other animal
fats. Another form is fried fat&mdash;fat which has been chemically
changed by heat with the development of certain irritating
acids.</p>

<h4>MINERAL SALTS</h4>

<p>The mineral elements comprise but a small part of human
food as regards weight, but they are extremely important to
the health of the child as well as the adult. As found in the
food, they are not in the form of mineral salts, like common
table salt. The salts of food are living salts, organic or organized
salts, such as are found in the growing plant. These salts<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">365</a></span>
are of great value to the various fluids of the body, and also as
stimulants to nerve action, but more particularly in the work
of building up the bones.</p>

<p>Salts are found largely in the cereals. A small amount is
also found in vegetables, particularly the potato, as well as in
most fruits.</p>

<h4>CELLULOSE</h4>

<p>Cellulose represents the great bulk of all vegetables and
fruits. It is digested by most animals, but in man it is digested
only to the extent of about thirty per cent. The presence of a
large amount of cellulose in the food enables us often to satisfy
the appetite without injury from overeating. It serves to
give bulk to the food, and thereby possibly acts as a preventive
to constipation.</p>

<h4>WATER</h4>

<p>Water fills an important place in the nutrition of the body.
The food changes in connection with digestion, assimilation,
and elimination, can take place only in the presence of water.
Water constitutes from fifteen to ninety-five per cent of the
various foods. The watery juices of vegetables and fruits
consist largely of pure, distilled water, in which fruit sugar
is dissolved, with added flavoring substances. Water is absolutely
essential to the performance of every vital function
connected with human metabolism.</p>

<h4>ANIMAL HEAT</h4>

<p>The source of heat in the animal body was the subject of
much superstitious speculation on the part of ancient scientists.
It is now known that animal heat is derived from the food we
eat by means of a peculiar process of vital oxidation&mdash;effected
in the presence of oxygen&mdash;by the action of water and enzymes
upon the food elements absorbed by the living cell. This process
of oxidation liberates the heat and energy stored by the sun
in the food, and thus the body is kept warm by this constant
combustion of the digested foodstuffs. The starches and
sugars, together with the fats, represent food elements which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">366</a></span>
serve as the body's fuel. By this means we are able to maintain
a constant body temperature of almost one hundred degrees.</p>

<p>The average human body produces enough heat every hour
to raise two and one-half pounds of water from the freezing
point to the boiling point. This is equivalent to boiling about
seven gallons of ice-water every twenty-four hours. Differently
expressed, the body gives off each hour the same amount
of heat as a foot and a half of two-inch steam coil. This is
the same amount of heat which would be produced by burning
about two-thirds of a pound of coal.</p>

<h4>FUEL VALUE OF FOODS</h4>

<p>Expressed in terms of English weight, the fuel value of the
three different food elements would be:</p>

<table border="0" width="450" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="5" summary="Essentials">
<col width="70%" />
<col width="30%" />
<tr><td align="left" valign="top">1 ounce of carbohydrates</td><td align="left" valign="top">127.5 calories</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top">1 ounce of proteins</td><td align="left" valign="top">127.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"</td></tr>
<tr><td align="left" valign="top">1 ounce of fat</td><td align="left" valign="top">289.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"</td></tr>
</table>

<p>It will be observed that fat contains more than twice as much
heat as the carbohydrates. This is due to the fact that fat contains
more carbon than either starch or sugar. Next to fats,
starches and sugars are the most important fuel elements. Protein
is a very extravagant form of food for fuel purposes. Proteins
are the most expensive elements of human food; they are
incompletely burned in the body, and inasmuch as they leave
behind distressing and disease-producing ashes, it is clearly evident
that only sufficient amount of proteins should be eaten each
day to supply the demand of the body for repairs. We should
depend more largely upon the carbohydrates and fats for heat
and energy.</p>

<p>A large part of our food is required to furnish heat to take
the place of that lost by radiation from the skin, and this is
why children require more food than adults&mdash;they have a
larger skin surface in proportion to their weight, and therefore
lose more heat by radiation, and it is for this reason that the
food for the growing child must be wisely and carefully
selected.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">367</a></span></p>

<h4>DIET FOR CHILD TWO TO THREE YEARS OLD</h4>

<p><i>Breakfast</i>, 7-8 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>: Fruit; cooked or toasted cereal served

<p><i>Supper</i>, 5-6 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span>: Fruit, bread (bran bread if constipated);
milk; porridge, with rich milk or milk toast; sweetened graham
crackers.</p>

<h4>FOODS ALLOWED CHILDREN OF FOUR YEARS AND OLDER</h4>

<p><i>Protein Dishes</i>: Purees of dried peas; lentils; beans; macaroni;
eggs&mdash;soft boiled, poached, scrambled, or omelette; meats&mdash;steak,
chops, chicken, turkey, broiled fish.</p>

<p><i>Cereals</i>: All the toasted-flake foods; toasted and not too fresh
bread, including both graham and bran; hominy; corn meal;
oatmeal; farina; rice; barley; tapioca; sago, etc.</p>

<p><i>Soups</i>: Creamed vegetable soups of all kinds and broths.</p>

<p><i>Vegetables</i>: Potatoes; all the small green vegetables; lettuce;
stewed celery; beets; squash; cauliflower, etc.</p>

<p><i>Fruits</i>: All, if stewed or baked. Raw fruits&mdash;pears, peaches,
ripe apples, berries, oranges, persimmons, grape-pulp without
seeds, etc.</p>

<p><i>Desserts</i>: Custard; jellos; junkets; home-made ice cream;
sponge cake; baked fruits with whipped cream, etc.</p>

<h4>FOODS TO BE AVOIDED BY YOUNG CHILDREN</h4>

<p>1. <i>Doughy breads</i>, griddle cakes, insides of muffins, hot biscuits,
etc.</p>

<p>2. <i>Fried meats</i>, such as sausage, oysters, pork, ham, veal, salt
fish, corned beef, dried beef, etc.</p>

<p>3. <i>Foods that are hot when they are cold</i>&mdash;such as catsup,
horse radish, mustard, highly spiced pickles, sauces, etc.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">368</a></span></p>

<p>4. <i>Rich pastries</i>, puddings, unripe fruit, salted peanuts, and
highly concocted dishes.</p>

<p>5. <i>Certain salads</i>, containing coarse but easily swallowed
foods, with highly seasoned sauces.</p>

<p>6. <i>Tea, coffee, and all alcoholic beverages.</i></p>

<p>7. <i>Soft candies</i>, chocolate creams, bon-bons, patties, etc.</p>

<p>Average normal children crave sweets, and since their normal
food is about seven per cent sugar it is not to be wondered
at. There are many forms of pure, hard candies which may
be taken by the three-year-old child. They are stick candy,
fruit tablets, sunshine candies, and other varieties which may
be sucked.</p>

<p>All soft candies, such as chocolate creams, bon-bons, patties,
etc., are to be avoided. Hard candies, taken along with the
desserts at meal time, in no wise injure the normal stomach
of the healthy child.</p>

<p>The other members of the family should set a correct example
by sucking the hard candies rather than chewing them; for if
the hard candies are allowed to dissolve slowly in the mouth
they produce a weak solution of sugar, which does not interfere
with digestion as do the strong and concentrated sugar solutions
which result from chewing chocolate creams, bon-bons, etc.</p>

<p>Candy, cookies, sandwiches, or bits of cake should never be
allowed between the meals.</p>

<h4>EATING BETWEEN MEALS</h4>

<p>Children who do not eat well at the breakfast table, if given
a "piece" at 10 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span>, will not be ready for the 12 o'clock
meal; and then another "piece" at 2 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span> interferes with the
normal appetite at 6 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span> Digestion is disturbed, the nervous
system irritated, and a "puny child" is often the result.</p>

<p>Bring the three-or-four-year-old to a well-selected breakfast
some time between 7 and 8 <span class="smcap">a. m.</span> Then nothing&mdash;absolutely
nothing&mdash;but water must pass the lips between that breakfast
hour and the 12 o'clock meal, which should be a good one.
Then the interval until 5 or 6 <span class="smcap">p. m.</span> is passed in the same manner.
At the evening meal the appetite is again whetted: and
a good appetite always means good gastric juice to digest the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">369</a></span>
meal. And so, good mother, guard carefully the interval
between meals if you would have good digestion and good health
for the little folks.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVI</h2>
<h2>CARETAKERS AND GOVERNESSES</h2>
</div>

<p>Because of her versatile adaptability to the management
of details, woman, all through the ages, has willingly and
happily sacrificed herself upon the altar of service. It is not
in the province of this chapter to go into the details of the
tribal life of the early hordes and clans that came from the
north and from the east to establish civilization in the cities of
Rome and Britain&mdash;space forbids. In this chapter we wish
to hold up a picture to the mother, a picture which may speak
volumes to her soul; one which perhaps she may ruthlessly throw
away&mdash;nevertheless, we propose to exhibit it.</p>

<h4>HOMEMAKING VS. HOUSEKEEPING</h4>

<p>A newspaper woman in my office recently told me a story
of a mother who finished her high-school education, took some
work in a university, and who yielded to the earnest pleas of
her lover-classmate through grammar school, high school and
college&mdash;and married him. To this happy family there came
a number of beautiful children. The mother willingly, lovingly,
cared for them during their helpless infancy&mdash;made their
clothes, managed their meals, opened the door for them as
they came home from school, met them with a cheery story,
listened to their problems, helped them with their lessons&mdash;but
all through it, first, last and all the time, she also managed the
entire home. She dusted the furniture, changed the curtains,
looked after the linen, mended the clothes, and even pressed
the trousers of her "rapidly rising" husband that he might go
out into his "club life" and enjoy the evenings with his associates.
The duties of the day so wearied her, and the night
vigils with the sick child,&mdash;looking after the little coughs, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">371</a></span>
uncovered shoulders, getting the drinks of water and performing
a dozen other details&mdash;that she was too weary to accompany
her husband to the dance, to the theater, to the social gathering
or to ladies' night at the club; and so, in the course of a dozen
years, the mother had grown old, and quite naturally she had
grown "home centered." Her world's horizon was the walls
of her home. She was happy and quite contented in her children's
smiles, in the cheery "how do you do" of her husband,
in the fact that that gravy was good or that steak was fried to
the king's taste.</p>

<p>She was happy and contented until one day when the awakening
blow came. In the attic she and her thirteen-year-old son,
who was just entering high school, were looking through an
old chest when she drew forth some examination reports and
some old school cards&mdash;holding them up side by side. One set
of the cards bore the father's name and the other set the
mother's maiden name. In great surprise the boy exclaimed,
"Why, mother, I never knew you studied algebra and Latin;
why, mother, I never knew you were educated." Her eyes were
immediately opened, the scales fell off, she was awakened to
the fact that her own son was coming to regard his mother as
somewhat inferior, in intellectual attainments, to the father&mdash;that
she was considered in that home as a mere domestic.
True, the steak had been broiled well, the pudding was
exquisite, the children's clothes were always in order, the husband's
trousers were always beautifully pressed, his ties were
cleaned as well as a cleaner could clean them; but where did
she stand in her boy's mind and where was she in her husband's
mind?</p>

<p>"Do you notice how trim and nice Mrs. Smith always looks?
Her clothes are always in the latest style, and she combs her
hair so becomingly." Such remarks as this from the well-meaning
husband cut keenly, and it is well that they do, for often
it is only such remarks that wake up our "home mother."</p>

<p>Dear reader, I want you to ponder this story. I wish to say
to the mother who has started out upon a career in life, who has
prepared herself for teaching school, for a business career, for
story writing, for millinery, for lecturing, or has perhaps gradu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">372</a></span>ated
in a domestic science course, that she makes the mistake of
her life in settling down, just because she has taken another's
name, to be perfectly satisfied with becoming the household
domestic, the household mender, the household cook.</p>

<h4>MOTHERS IN THE PROFESSIONS</h4>

<p>I have in my acquaintance scores of mothers in the professions,
newspaper women, women who have carved out brilliant careers
for themselves, women who have taught school for twenty years
while their children have been growing up, women physicians
who have risen in the esteem of all their professional brothers
and sisters, women who have conducted cooking schools, who
have occupied positions of trust in hospitals and in every walk
of life, and who have successfully reared children at the same
time.</p>

<p>You will pardon me for being personal when I say that
since our own little fellow was six weeks old his clothes have
been washed and mended and his food has been prepared by
earnest and honest women who had not fitted themselves for
the career which this boy's mother had chosen. His mother
went to her office, cared for her patients, kept up by the side
of her husband in the battle of life. All the time there was
a woman at home just devoted to that little fellow.</p>

<p>A newspaper woman recently told me her story&mdash;a story
which should impress everyone of my readers as it did myself,
and she, like many other mothers in the professions, leaves her
home as the little fellow goes to school. His hands have been
washed, his bowels have moved, his hair has been combed, his
breakfast has been eaten by the side of his mother&mdash;she has
directed it all. He goes forth to the schoolroom and she goes
forth to her profession. All through the day she lovingly keeps
in mind these children that are growing up. She works the
harder, real love entering into everything she does, because
she is not merely earning the bread that goes into their mouths,
but is forming a character not only for herself but, because
of her broadened horizon, is instilling into their little minds the
possibilities of their own career, their own opportunity to enter
into the world's work as real world workers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">373</a></span></p>

<p>I contend that the mother in a profession has many blessings
that the mother who remains at home never has. The mother
who remains at home has a viewpoint that is often quite likely,
wholly unconsciously, of course, to become small, to become
narrow, to become focused upon small details; on the other
hand, the mother whose mind and whose heart are so full
of the affairs of the office, of the newspaper article she
has just written, or the lecture she has just given or is
about to give, or the meeting that she is to preside over, is
quite likely to become somewhat irritated sometimes if the little
fellow doesn't stand quietly to have his hair combed, she is
quite likely to "feel rushed;" but under all circumstances, dear
reader, whether this mother be a home mother or in a profession,
never, never must she allow mental panic to seize her.
Ever must we keep in mind that these little ones are just children&mdash;children
that are still in the developmental stage.</p>

<h4>WORK OUTSIDE THE HOME</h4>

<p>And now for the home mother. I believe it is necessary and
of paramount importance that she get away from her children
(if possible) several hours each day; that she provide for them
a caretaker who can relieve the children of her or relieve her
of the children, whichever way you may look at it, for we are
inclined to think that the children often tire of the mother just
about as often as the mother tires of the children. I would
have the woman who remains at home, whose husband is able
to provide outside help for the heavy work of the house,
enter into some uplifting neighborhood work, social settlement
work, church work, wholesome club work&mdash;anything
but bridge and whist and gambling games. I would have
them bring into the nursery a woman who is cheery, who is
capable of teaching games, of entertaining and amusing these
little folks under their own roof.</p>

<p>The woman who has graduated from high school, who has a
diploma to teach, I would have take a school or, at least, do
substitute work. She will be happier&mdash;far happier&mdash;continuing
along the lines for which she has prepared herself, even
if all the money she earns be used to pay the help. Some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">374</a></span>
women are especially fitted for the important work of mother
and homemaker, and such wives will find for themselves a
worthy career in the home and its neighborhood activities.
Each woman must find a field of action suited to her own
temperament, education, experience, talents, and opportunities.</p>

<h4>SELECTING A CARETAKER</h4>

<p>For a caretaker, the professional or business woman should
not select an ignorant servant girl; that would be a great mistake&mdash;a
crime&mdash;a violation of the law that should govern
the training of these little people who have come to us to be
reared and cared for and fitted to occupy their place among
the world's workers. As a rule, one soul does not possess the
qualifications for scrubbing and laundry work and also the
firm but gentle ministering qualifications necessary for a successful
caretaker. They do not combine as a rule. It has
been my experience, as a mother with a profession, and that
of many others of my acquaintances, that an art student or a
music student makes a splendid caretaker. There are hundreds
and hundreds of genteel women, with winning manners and
beautiful dispositions, who may be obtained to sew on the buttons,
wash the faces, and change the clothes of our darlings
while we are carrying forward in the world the great work for
which we have fitted ourselves during the long struggles of our
teens and early twenties.</p>

<p>The young woman who is brought in to care for the child
should be above the usual "servant" class. She must eat in
our dining-room, she should be welcome in the living-room or
sun parlor, and be treated as a respected member of the family.
Her salary is usually not large for she realizes that she is given
something in that home&mdash;something that money cannot buy.</p>

<h4>THE UP-TO-DATE MOTHER</h4>

<p>Now this young woman (the caretaker) wants to hold her
position, and so she is very anxious to carry out in detail the
laws and rules that are laid down by the mother. Mother can
keep abreast with the world, mother has time to read periodicals
that keep her in touch with the great, wide, pulsating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">375</a></span>
affairs of life. She is able to meet more women worth while,
and with her husband attend lectures, musicals, theaters, and
other places for intellectual culture.</p>

<p>Anyone of my readers need not look four blocks from her
home to find a mother who is run down at the heel, whose
dresses are calico, whose hat is five or six years old, whose
black silk dress (the only one she ever had) is worn shiny
or threadbare, who works and saves every penny that she can
that her children may look well; and, even when the husband
does invite her to go out with him, he will often be confronted
with this remark: "John, I would like to go, but really my
clothes are a little bit shabby." The world is just full of such
women, with their very hearts being eaten out of them for
the want of a beautiful gown, a beautiful hat or a pretty pair
of evening shoes, and they might have them every one if they
would be willing to allow the duties of the household to be
presided over by a woman that cannot do the things the
mother can do, while she goes out and accrues a number of
dollars each week which will more than provide for the things
that her soul desires so that she may go well dressed by the
side of her husband in quest of that very necessary intellectual
culture and social diversion.</p>

<p>The wife of a prominent judge, in my office just this week,
said to me that she believed that most of our social and domestic
uneasiness was due to the fact that fathers and mothers and
children went out together so seldom. The father goes to
his club, the children go to their little gatherings, and mother
usually stays at home; although of late, she is beginning to
realize the value of the women's clubs.</p>

<h4>QUALIFICATIONS OF THE GOVERNESS</h4>

<p>The caretaker should not be too old. It is a very great
blessing if there is an older sister in the family who can come
in and assist with this work, or if there is an aunt. If one
is to be selected from the open market, then we suggest a
woman in her late teens or early twenties whose heart is full
of play, whose face is sunny, and who is young enough to
appreciate and like the becomingness of youthful dress. It is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">376</a></span>
needless to say she should be free from tuberculosis and other
diseases. She should be trustworthy enough not to administer
soothing syrups because the children won't sleep, or to give
candy when mother has forbidden her, or to teach the children
bad habits of any sort.</p>

<p>It is impossible to exercise too much care in the selection of
this substitute mother, and when you do find one it is often wise
not to keep her too long. A year or so is plenty long enough
for any person to be with our children. It is only necessary
for anyone to walk out into the public parks and casually listen
to the conversations of many of the "chewing-gum caretakers"
to discover with what carelessness some people select
caretakers for their children. The language they use is not
only ungrammatical but oftentimes both slangy and profane.
The flirtations carried on with many of the park policemen and
bystanders lead us to feel that many people arrive at the idea
that their little folks "will grow up some way." If the caretaker
is a student, a young woman of culture, and is kept with
the family, she will be found to be more circumspect and dependable.
Her gentleman friend, if she has one, should be allowed
to come to the home. She does not have to meet him out in
the park any more than a sister would have to go away from
home to meet a friend; and, to my mind, everything centers
around the viewpoint of the mother as she selects this caretaker,
for if she is her social equal it puts her in a different
place entirely to the well-meaning but ignorant servant girl to
whose care is often intrusted the lives of the little people.</p>

<h4>HINTS FOR THE CARETAKER</h4>

<p>There are a number of hints we wish to bring together in
this chapter for the mother to suggest to the caretaker. For
instance, here is a group that one author gives us:</p>

<h5>BABY IS HAPPY BECAUSE</h5>

</p>

<h4>OVERCOMING BAD HABITS</h4>

<p>There are a few bad habits which older children fall into
such as lip-sucking or thumb-sucking or finger-sucking which
not only narrow and deform the upper jaw, but likewise deform
the hand itself. They should be stopped at the earliest opportunity
by pinning the sleeve to the bedding or putting mittens
on the hand or putting a slight splint on the anterior bend of
the elbow. Some children suck their handkerchiefs, or bite
holes in their aprons and neckties.</p>

<p>Children often bite their finger nails, and a habit of this kind
fully developed during early childhood often remains with them
throughout life; whenever a nervous spell seizes them they
instantly begin to bite their finger nails. Other people pick
their nose when nervous, so during very early childhood these
habits should be discouraged. One mother helped her little son
by beautifully manicuring his nails for him each week. Another
child was cured by old-fashioned spanking. The finger tips
may be painted with tincture of aloes, or dipping the tips of
the fingers in strong quinine water will sometimes help. I
know of nothing better for the adolescent child than to teach
him how properly to manicure his own nails. Another bad
habit that children often get into is stooping or allowing the
shoulders to become rounded. Shoulder braces are not indicated
in these cases. The children should be allowed to enter the
gymnasium or the father should take off his coat and vest and
go through gymnasium stunts with the boy. The mother can do
the same for the girl. It is often the case that round-shouldered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">379</a></span>
children are near sighted. The child really has to stoop to see
things. When a child holds his head to one side constantly on
looking at objects, astigmatism, an error of eyesight, is usually
indicated. An eye specialist should be consulted, the eyes examined,
and properly fitted eye glasses should be worn.</p>

<p>Just as early as possible in the life of the little child he should
be taught to blow his nose, to spit out the coughed up mucus from
his lungs, to hold out his tongue for inspection and to allow his
throat to be examined. He should be taught to gargle, and to
regard the physician as one of his best friends. Attention to
these minor accomplishments will make it very easy indeed for
the physician in case of illness.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVII</h2>
<h2>THE POWER OF POSITIVE SUGGESTIONS</h2>
</div>

<p>A child is the most imitative creature in the world. Before
he is out of pinafores he tries to talk and act just like
his elders. It is because of this inherent tendency to say and
do those very things which he hears others say and do, that, if
faith-thoughts are early and constantly suggested to the unfolding
mind of the child they will assist greatly in evolving a character
of joy, confidence, and courage. On the other hand, if
fear-thoughts are continuously sown in the young mind they
will eventually distort the emotions, deform the conceptions, and
wholly demoralize the health and life activities of the growing
child. Within the limitations of the possibilities of hereditary
endowment, and in view of this wonderful imitative nature, we
are able to make of a child almost anything we desire; not "an
angel," in the ordinary acceptation of the term, but a child who
knows his place and possesses the power of normal self-control.</p>

<h4>EARLY FEARS</h4>

<p>From two to six years of age, when the imagination is most
plastic and vivid, when the child's imitative instinct is so unconsciously
automatic, is the most effective and opportune time to
initiate good habits and lay the foundations for the later development
of a strong and noble character. "Baby's skies are
Mamma's eyes" is just as true as it is poetical. While a tired
and worn-out mother, exhausted by a multitude of harrassing
household cares, may be pardoned for her occasional irritability,
nevertheless the little one unconsciously partakes of her spirit.
When the mother is happy the child is happy. When Mother
is sick and nervous the child is impatient and irritable.</p>

<p>It is unfortunate that this very time of a child's life, when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">381</a></span>
we can do practically anything we choose with him, is the very
time when so many parents fill the child's mind with the unhealthful
fear-thoughts. "The bogie man'll get you if you don't
mind Mamma," or, "I'll get the black man to cut your ears off,"
or, "the chimney sweep is around the corner to take bad little
boys," are familiar threats which are so frequently made to the
little folks. These efforts to terrorize the young child into
obedience never fail to distort the mind, warp the affections,
and, more or less permanently, derange the entire nervous system.
The arousal of fear-thoughts and fearful emotions in the
mind of the growing child is very often such a psychologic
and a physiologic shock to the child that the results are sometimes
not wholly eradicated in an entire lifetime.</p>

<p>Just see how far we carry this unwholesome introduction of
fear-thoughts&mdash;even to the Almighty. Thousands of us remember
being told as a child that "God don't like naughty boys," or,
"God will send the bad man to get you if you don't be good."
Thus, early in life, an unwholesome fear of the Supreme Being
is sown in the mind of the child, and, as time passes, these false
fears grow and come so to possess the mind and control the
emotions that in adult life this early teaching comes to mold the
character and shape the religious beliefs of the individual.</p>

<p>To the child who has been reared to dread God, who has come
to look upon the Creator as an ever present "threat," how is it
possible to convey the beautiful teaching of His fatherhood?</p>

<h4>FEAR OF NOISES</h4>

<p>How frequently some unusual noise leads a parent to say:
"Keep still! What was that? Did you hear that noise?" The
little folks of the family are startled, their eyes grow large and
their faces pale, while they cling to the frightened mother. Of
course, investigation usually shows that the strange and alarming
noise was merely the slamming of a cellar door, the rattling
of a curtain in the wind, some one walking about downstairs, or
the action of the new furnace regulator in the basement. But
meantime the harm is done to the children&mdash;fear, the worst
enemy of childhood, has been unconsciously planted in the mind
by the thoughtless and nervous parent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">382</a></span></p>

<h4>FEAR OF DARKNESS</h4>

<p>Consider for a moment the thousands of children who are
early taught an abnormal fear of the dark. Even when the
child is absolutely free from such a fear, when sent into a dark
room some member of the family will thoughtlessly remark, "Do
you think it is quite right to send that child into that dark room?
Suppose something should happen." The child quickly catches
the suggestion that something is supposed to be or happen in the
dark, and in his mind is sown the seed of fear.</p>

<p>When our boy was about two years old he was carried one
night to the window by a caretaker, and as they looked out into
the darkness the young woman said, "Boo! dark!" The little
fellow shuddered, drew back and repeated, "Boo! dark! Boo!
dark!"</p>

<p>That night, as was our custom after the evening story, we
tucked him in his little bed, turned out the light, and saying,
"Sweet dreams, Darling," closed the door. Imagine our surprise
to hear, "Mamma, Mamma, Willie 'fraid of dark, Willie
'fraid of dark," and it was with difficulty that he was induced to
go to sleep in the dark. Immediate inquiry revealed the occasion
of his fears, and the next night we set about to eradicate the
fear of darkness from the little fellow's mind.</p>

<p>For ten successive nights we took his hand, and, leading him
into a dark room, said, "Nice dark, restful dark; we go to sleep
in the dark; we're not afraid of the dark, no." Each night,
save one, we were met with, "No, no, naughty dark. Willie
'fraid of dark." On the tenth night as we entered the room as
usual, repeating, "Nice dark, restful dark; we go to sleep in the
dark; we're not afraid of the dark, no," his little mind responded.
Suggestion had at last routed fear and given birth to
faith. We had won! But it had taken ten nights of constant
work to undo one moment's work of a thoughtless girl. Every
night since he has gone to sleep in the dark without a murmur.</p>

<h4>THE FOLLY OF MAKING THREATS</h4>

<p>Threats only show weakness on the part of the disciplinarian.
Most school teachers early learn the folly of making threats.
When I was teaching school I recall that a number of slate pen<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">383</a></span>cils
had been dropped on the floor one afternoon. Thoughtlessly
I threatened, "Now the next child that drops a pencil
will remain after school and receive punishment!" My fate!
The weakest, most delicate girl in the room was the next to drop
her pencil, and she was a pupil with a perfect record in deportment.
The reader can imagine my embarrassment. I had
threatened punishment, and so had to get out of the predicament
as best I could. This experience effectually cured me of making
such foolish threats.</p>

<p>Most of us live to regret the threats we make. "Your father
will thrash you when he comes home tonight," or, "You'd better
not let your father see you doing that," or, "You wouldn't behave
that way if your father was here," etc., are common threats
which we hear directed at headstrong and willful boys. What
is the result? Do such threats cause the love of the child for
his father to increase? They make the child actually afraid of
his father.</p>

<p>"I'll 'bust' your brains out," said a four-year-old to his pet
lion, because it wouldn't stand up. Now it should be remembered
that these things do not originate in the minds of the boy
and girl. They only repeat the things they hear others say. It
betrays both cowardice and ignorance to undertake to secure
obedience by such threats as "I will box your ears if you don't
mind," etc.</p>

<p>Obedience that is worth anything at all is only secured
by suggestion and love, never by promises of reward or threats
of punishment.</p>

<h4>CHILDREN WHO ARE CALLED "COWARDS"</h4>

<p>Recently we overheard a little fellow say, "Father says I'm
the only coward in the whole family." Looking him straight in
the face we said to him: "You're not a coward. Such a fine
boy as you couldn't possibly be a coward." The boy was greatly
amazed, and, as we left him, he was saying over to himself,
"I'm not a coward. She said I'm not a coward," finally adding,
"She said I couldn't be a coward." This one thought, repeated
to him several times and turned over and over in his mind,
eventually overthrew the false fears instilled by his father.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">384</a></span></p>

<p>A short time ago the daily papers contained the story of the
ten-year-old son of a New York business man who drew his
few dollars from the savings bank, boarded a train for Chicago,
and, after three days of amusement and loneliness, his money
all gone, was found in a hotel bitterly weeping. His identity was
revealed, the parents were notified at once, and the boy was sent
on the first train back to his home. On the way to the station
he sobbed out through his tears, "Well, my brother can't call me
a coward any more, anyway." Who knows but that this everlasting
taunting of the child with the accusation of being a baby
or being a coward has much to do with many such escapades
and other daring exploits on the part of the juveniles who are
chafed by such unjust insinuations? Those of us who are
acquainted with the vice and crime of a great city can imagine
just what might have happened if this boy had been a little older,
if his heredity had not been so good, if his money hadn't run
out, if he had been able to remain in the big city long enough
to make undesirable acquaintances.</p>

<p>Many criminals have confessed behind prison bars that when
they were children they were called cowards. After a while
they actually came to believe that they were cowards, and in
their efforts to acquire courage and demonstrate their bravery
they were led to desperate and even criminal acts. They prowled
around the dark alleys just to convince themselves that they
were not afraid, that they were not cowards, and there they
made the acquaintance of the criminals who led them into new
and dangerous paths. Even if a child enters this world handicapped
by heredity, let us not lessen his chances of success by
adverse suggestion.</p>

<p>Faith-thoughts, thoughts of bravery and of courage, may
just as easily be instilled into the mind of the normal child as
thoughts of fear and cowardice. A child should never have
suggested to him that he is afraid. He should be constantly
assured that he is brave, loyal, and fearless. The daily repetition
of these suggestions will contribute much to the actual
acquirement of the very traits of character that are thus suggested.
This does not mean that a child should not be taught
caution and forethought.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">385</a></span></p>

<h4>THE GIRL WHO WOULD "TURN OUT BAD"</h4>

<p>Parents do not begin to realize how fearfully dangerous is
this habit of constantly reiterated negative suggestion. Let me
illustrate by an actual incident: A beautiful girl in a near-by
state grew up quietly in the little village until she was eighteen
years of age, when suddenly she decided to run away from
home, declaring she was old enough to do as she pleased. She
confided in one of her girl friends that she was going to Chicago,
and had made all arrangements to lose herself in the
"redlight" district. All that this girl friend said had not the
slightest influence. As the train bore her away to the city and
to ruin, a social worker in Chicago was wired to meet her at
a suburban station. The girl was met, taken from the train
and whisked in a cab to the home of a Christian woman. So
possessed was this girl with the idea of throwing herself away
that the captain of police was asked to talk to her; but the
combined efforts of the police captain, a magistrate, and several
Christian people could not persuade her to recall her threat.
She declared she would kill herself if her parents were notified.
This siege lasted for ten days. Then she finally broke down,
saying: "I simply can't help it. All my life my mother has
told me that I was going to turn out bad. No matter what
would happen at home, if I broke a dish or went out with the
young people and remained away ten minutes later than I was
told to, it would always be thrown up to me. 'Oh, some day
you'll turn out bad.' I have heard it until I am sick of it, and
something within seems to push me on and on, telling me I
must turn out bad."</p>

<p>Of course the girl was persuaded to believe that these were
only fear-thoughts; that she was a beautiful, virtuous girl, that
she simply had received the wrong training, that she couldn't
possibly turn out bad. She was thus saved by the sympathy
and advice of understanding friends, was subsequently married
and is today the mother of a splendid boy.</p>

<h4>WHAT HEALTHY FAITH-THOUGHT WILL DO</h4>

<p>Here is another story which illustrates what healthy faith-thought
will do. A young man was not long ago selected for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_386" id="Page_386">386</a></span>
the highest position within the gift of a large religious organization.
When he was a lad his parents held this thought constantly
before his mind: "David, if you will be a good boy,
if you will do what is right, you may some day be President of
the General Assembly." He became a minister of the Gospel,
a very successful one, and subsequently married a young woman
who was also much interested in religious work. She continued
to encourage him in this ambition, saying: "David, preach the
best sermons you can; make an effort to bring many souls to
Christ, and some day I believe you will be President of the
General Assembly." The man presided over the General Assembly
of his denomination, not one term, but term after term.
He kept his eye long fixed on that particular aim, and by faith
he won it.</p>

<h4>THE POWER OF SUGGESTION</h4>

<p>To see how powerful suggestion may be in a child's life take
this incident that every parent knows: The little one trips
and tumbles. Mamma says, "Oh, did you fall? Well, never
mind; come here, I'll kiss it. There, now it's well." Immediately
the child goes back to his play perfectly happy. One little
fellow was taught that when he fell he should get up at once,
rub the bump, and say, "That didn't hurt." All through his
career the bumps and the hardships of life were met with the
same pluck. On the other hand, a thoughtless caretaker will
excitedly jump and catch up the slightly injured child, coddle
it, rock it, pet it&mdash;and the crying continues indefinitely. This
early training in meeting minor hurts and obstacles lasts
throughout the lifetime. Pluck and grit are lacking. The behavior
of the man in the face of difficulties is foreshadowed by
the attitude of the child toward his petty trials and bumps.</p>

<p>Successful child training follows in the path of positive suggestion.
Impatient words and careless threats of punishment
can only contribute to the wrong training of the young mind.</p>

<p>When is the best time to suggest to the child? Catch the
little fellow when he is happiest, when he is overjoyed and
filled with glee; for it is at such times that the suggestions
offered will meet with the least resistance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_387" id="Page_387">387</a></span></p>

<p>Teach the children through the spirit of play and through
the medium of the story. The boy or girl in the story always
can have a clean face, always close the doors quietly, and otherwise
so conduct himself or herself as to constitute a powerful
positive suggestion for good. The story-child always says,
"All right, Papa," "All right, Mamma," when corrected.</p>

<h4>BEDTIME A GOOD TIME TO SUGGEST</h4>

<p>The "going-to-bed time" is the time <i>par excellence</i> for suggestion
in early childhood. After the play time, the study
time, and the evening story, when all is quiet, in the peacefulness
of the darkness, while you are seated in a low chair close
beside the little bed, with your hand in his, repeat over and
over again the positive suggestions which you desire to take
root in the mind and bear fruit in the character. Again and
again tell the little fellow that he is the noblest and bravest of
boys, that he loves truth and hates deceit. No matter what
disturbs him, if it is the lessons at school or a wrong habit,
first think out exactly what you desire him to be or to do, and
firmly, but quietly, tell it over and over to him.</p>

<p>As a concrete example: Suppose Henry, at three-and-a-half
years of age has to be coaxed or almost forced to eat. Say
to him: "Now, Henry, you are a good little boy. Papa and
mamma love you dearly. If you are going to grow up to be
a big man you must not forget to eat; so tomorrow when you
go down to the table you will eat everything mamma or nurse
puts before you. It won't be necessary for papa to feed you
at all; you will eat the potatoes, the gravy, the toast, and the
cereal, and drink your milk. You will make mamma very
happy, and papa will be proud of you; and then after dinner
we will have a good romp, and you will soon grow up to be
big enough to have a velocipede and a watch." After two or
three evenings of this suggestion you will be surprised to see
there is a great difference in his eating.</p>

<p>Take the timid little girl who is unable to recite well at
school, who is shy, and has great difficulty with her lessons. At
the going-to-sleep time sit by the side of her bed and tell her
that tomorrow she will have her lessons better, that she will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_388" id="Page_388">388</a></span>
not any more be afraid, that she will get up and recite without
the least fear in her heart. By constantly repeating these suggestions
she will be given confidence, and in most cases it will
result in effecting the deliverance of the child from her bondage
to fear. Never tell her that she is shy or that she cannot
do things. Constantly tell her that she is a successful girl with
a strong character, and that she is going to make a very useful
and courageous woman. Hold high aims and ideals before her.
Suggestion cannot atone for all the defects of character which
may be inherited, but it can do much to help such unfortunate
little ones gracefully bear their burdens.</p>

<h4>NEVER ACCUSE CHILDREN OF DISHONESTY</h4>

<p>Never tell children that you suspect they are dishonest or
untruthful. Be very slow to accuse and suspect them of falsehood
or theft. Tell them over and over again they are the best
boys and girls in the world; that they are going to make the
noblest of men and women; that they love honesty and truth.
Even when you discover them in minor faults do not make
the mistake of unduly magnifying and emphasizing the error.
As soon as possible direct the thoughts and attention of the
wrongdoer away from his error, and focus his thoughts and
attention on the high goal you expect him to reach. This will
not be construed as doing away with proper punishment for
persistent faults after the more ideal methods seem to have
failed.</p>

<p>A patient recently called us to see her little girl, and as we
made ready to make the examination the mother said: "Now,
Mary, stop your playing and come and be undressed and let
the doctor look at you."</p>

<p>"I don't want to stop playing," murmured Mary.</p>

<p>"But you must come. You know you don't feel well at all,
your cheeks are so red. Now swallow and see if it don't
hurt. Now try again. I know you don't feel well." By the
time we had begun our examination Mary began to succumb
to her mother's suggestions, and began to feel a trifle indisposed.
She was being made temporarily ill by the unwise and
unfortunate suggestions of the overanxious mother. The ex<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_389" id="Page_389">389</a></span>amination
revealed that there was nothing whatever the matter
with her.</p>

<h4>IT IS EASY TO FORM GOOD HABITS</h4>

<p>Let us get the truth firmly into our minds as parents that
it is just about as easy to form a good habit as a bad habit,
just about as easy to acquire helpful, happy thoughts as those
that are injurious; and we can do it, if we will but see to it
that our children early form correct and proper habits of thinking
and acting. While the children are taught proper respect
for authority, let fear be an unknown word to them. Don't
let a thought of the fear of insanity, of haunted houses, of
drafts, of this and of that enter into your home. Instead, live
in the glorious sunshine of strong, healthy, faith-thought, and
a supreme happiness will come into your life, and you will give
a legacy to your children for which they will "rise up and call
you blessed."</p>

<h4>CHIVALROUS SPIRIT</h4>

<p>The love of mother and sister can naturally and happily be
turned early to a chivalrous attitude toward all women when
it is developed by suggestion and other training. In giving up
a chair or bringing one for a guest, in lifting the hat, in noticing
ways to be polite and attentive to mother, a lifelong conduct may
be ensured.</p>

<p>Each day gives us trying and sometimes shocking revelations
of the prevalent lack of courtesy, or even humanity, on the street
cars during the "rush" hours. The indifference to the comfort
of women, even the aged, on the part of many men and boys in
the matter of giving them seats or other care, indicates a dangerous
social condition.</p>

<p>The mother, instead of exercising selfish concern for her
boy, should make it her duty very early to suggest that he give
his seat to a woman or girl, as he would be glad to have someone
do for his mother or sister. Such unselfish service will
become a habit of pleasure, and help the boy become a pure-minded,
manly gentleman with that respect for womanhood
without which a nation is doomed.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXVIII</h2>
<h2>PLAY AND RECREATION</h2>
</div>

<p>There are a number of theories advocated by late authors
on the "psychology of play," in which they connect the
free and easy play of the modern child with the more serious
and sober pursuits of our ancestors&mdash;our racial parents of
prehistoric and primitive times. We quote from <i>Worry and
Nervousness</i>:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>And so we are told that the spectacle of the young infant suspending
its weight while holding on to some object, and the early instincts
so commonly shown to climb ladders, trees, or anything
else available, are but racial mementos of our ancestral forest life.
The hide and seek games, the desires to convert a blanket into a
tent, the instinct for "shanties"&mdash;which all boys universally manifest&mdash;we
are told that these forms of play are but the echo of remote
ages when our ancestors sojourned in caves, lived in tents, or dwelt
in the mountain fastness. In this same way the advocates of this
theory seek to explain the strange and early drawings which the
young lad has for wading, swimming, fishing, boating, and other
forms of aquatic recreation.<a name="fnanchor_5" id="fnanchor_5"></a><a href="#footnote_5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p></div>

<p>In this chapter we purpose to discuss the play of the child,
whose career we will divide, for convenience, into three stages:</p>

<ol>
<li>The age from three to six&mdash;juvenile days.</li>
<li>The age from six to twelve&mdash;the "going to school" child.</li>
<li>The age from twelve to twenty&mdash;the adolescent youth.</li>
</ol>

<p class="footnote"><a name="footnote_5" id="footnote_5"></a><a href="#fnanchor_5"><sup>5</sup></a> William S. Sadler, <i>Worry and Nervousness</i>, p. 377.</p>

<h4>JUVENILE PLAY DAYS</h4>

<p>As nearly as is possible the little child should be out of doors
the greater part of his waking hours: To our mind it is nothing
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_391" id="Page_391">391</a></span>short of criminal to keep the little folks in the house when the
weather permits outdoor life.</p>

<p>Of the outdoor games which we have to suggest, perhaps
the sand pile stands at the head of the list. Clean white sand
should be placed in an inclosure just low enough for the child
to climb over. Many, many happy hours may be spent in this
sand pile, at the same time the little fellow is in his own yard
and the watchful mother knows the drift of the conversations
which take place.</p>

<p>In a previous chapter we called attention to the fact that the
little girls' frocks should be provided with knickerbockers, so
that she may run and jump, or sit as comfortable as the little
boy, without a conscious reproof ever ringing in her ears,
"Mary, do keep your dress down."</p>

<h4>OUTDOOR PLAY</h4>

<p>Tree climbing is another source of enjoyment to these little
people and they should early be taught how to climb. Instead
of suggesting fear to the child let the mother go into the yard
and talk with her something like this: "Now, Mary, put your
foot in that fork, now catch hold of that upper limb, hold on
tight, you will get there yet;" instead of the following conversation,
which all of our readers have heard: "John, do
take care or you will fall and break your neck; be careful, you
will fall. There, I knew you'd fall!" etc. Both mothers are trying
to accomplish the same thing&mdash;one mother suggests "fore-thought,"
while the second mother thoughtlessly suggests
"fear-thought."</p>

<p>These little people should be provided with rakes, spades, and
hoes, and a portion of the yard should be given them in which
they are at liberty to dig and rake and have a royal good time.
We have yet to see the child who is not interested in flower-bed
making, and the mother should think of the virgin opportunity
to instill the story of life into the child's mind as he
plants the seed, and day by day watches its development and
growth.</p>

<p>A pen of rabbits may be a good thing, if proper measures
are taken to prevent their burrowing out of the pen, destroying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_392" id="Page_392">392</a></span>
the lawn, causing much sadness of heart to their little keeper,
and no end of annoyance to the neighbors.</p>

<p>Roller skating and hoop rolling, as well as sledding, are all
valuable recreations. The snowman, snowballing, and the sled
riding all bring the ruddy glow of health to the cheek, and are
wonderful producers of good appetites and restorers of "tired
out nerves."</p>

<h4>INDOOR GAMES</h4>

<p>There is no end to the number of things that can be done
when the weather shuts us in, but before we take up these
games let us never forget that every child thoroughly enjoys
going out in the rain well protected with rubber boots, raincoat,
and umbrella.</p>

<p>It is not extravagant to burn plenty of electricity or gas on
cloudy days, for the artificial sunlight helps to cheer the heart.
Such indoor games as those which may be had from blocks,
puzzles, cutting out of pictures, darning of cardboard, soldier
games, dolls, housekeeping, etc., are all splendid means of recreation
for the little ones. Let the mother or caretaker join
with the little folks in these pleasant games. For the older
children, checkers and dominoes are most excellent indoor
games.</p>

<h4>THE "GOING TO SCHOOL" CHILD</h4>

<p>First of all we must decide upon the bedtime hour, as well as
the hour for rising. Between the ages of six to twelve, the bedtime
hour should be eight o'clock, or not later than eight-thirty,
and the rising hour at seven, or seven-thirty in the morning, for
children of this age require eleven to twelve hours sleep.</p>

<p>Again, there must be taken into consideration the home work
that the children at school are asked to do by their teachers.
While this home work is not usually taxing, yet the time spent
in doing the work must be taken account of. In our opinion
the best time for home work is an hour and a half to two hours
after the little fellow gets home from school. He should be
allowed to relax for one and a half or two hours, to play out
of doors whenever the weather permits, and then with either<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_393" id="Page_393">393</a></span>
his mother or his caretaker from one-half to three-quarters of
an hour should be spent on the lesson for the following day.
Following this, the dinner hour is enjoyed with the parents,
and after that there should always be provision in the daily
duties of the father and mother for at least a half hour for the
evening romp; so that play and recreation during the school
age occupies possibly not more than two or two and one-half
hours a day outside of school hours.</p>

<p>The playgrounds of schools are of inestimable value, and we
quite agree with one who said: "If we can only afford one of
the two&mdash;the playground or the school&mdash;have the playground
first and afterward the school." The small parks and playgrounds
of the cities are a great blessing to the little folks.</p>

<h4>COMPANIONS</h4>

<p>The companions of the school child are usually his playfellows
at school, and we urge the throwing open of the home
during inclement weather to allow these school friends to come
in and make trains out of our chairs and tents out of our
couch covers, steamer rugs, afghans, etc.</p>

<p>We do suggest that caution be used in allowing children to
play indoors who are suffering from colds in the head, running
noses, running ears, tuberculosis, or other chronic disorders,
which are often highly contagious. Running noses and running
ears, as well as tuberculosis, may be contracted by susceptible
children when the play at recreation time takes place indoors;
while such disorders are much less dangerous in connection
with outdoor play.</p>

<p>We are well aware of the fact that some playmates may
choose the bathroom, requesting that doors be locked, or wish
to play in a bedroom securely away from mother and the caretaker.
Under no circumstances should this be allowed. Let
the child early learn that good wholesome play in the open is
better than secretive misdemeanor behind closed doors.</p>

<h4>THE "IN THE HOUSE" HOUR</h4>

<p>It is a pitiful fact that many mothers apparently are wholly
unconcerned as to the whereabouts of their little folks, even<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_394" id="Page_394">394</a></span>
after dusk; this is unwise to say the least, for a boy or girl
under twelve years of age should be found under the parental
roof at dusk. The city mother should impress upon her child
that when the street lamps are lighted his first duty is at once
to come into the house. During the winter months this lighting
of the street lamps occurs anywhere from four to six. During
the summer months another rule should be laid down, depending
upon the neighborhood, the character of the friends on
the street, the surroundings, etc. By all means let us see that
our young people are in the house by dusk.</p>

<h4>PARTIES</h4>

<p>Every mother who reads these lines has had to meet this
question: "Shall I let my little one begin to go to parties?"
and every mother will have to answer that question for herself.
We personally feel that the social life extended by the
school, together with the meeting of the companions at Sunday
school, in the park, or on the playground, is quite enough; and
we deplore the fact that many children grow into the idea that
much time must be spent at "parties" in the drawing-room
under unnatural surroundings, in dressed-up clothes, eating
ice cream and cake, etc. Outdoor gatherings of children are
wholesome and hygienic, but most of these indoor gatherings
of groups of children we consider decidedly unhygienic. One
child coming down with scarlet fever, measles, or whooping
cough can infect twenty others at an afternoon party. The
eating of so much ice cream, candy, and cake is deplorable in
that it upsets the digestion, and all this is irritating to the developing
nervous system of the child; and not infrequently
brings on a lot of other symptoms, resulting in discomfort and
disease. We believe in outdoor picnics but not in too frequent
indoor parties.</p>

<h4>PICNICS</h4>

<p>Groups of children gathering in the park, on the beach, in the
woods, when well chaperoned, are among the pleasant and
profitable pleasures of childhood. It is just such gatherings
that mothers and children should indulge in&mdash;and once a week<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_395" id="Page_395">395</a></span>
is not too often during the long vacation. The mothers, too,
should enter enthusiastically into the joys of a day's outing,
where the enormous intake of oxygen, the hearty laughter, the
races, the games, etc., all create a wonderful appetite, which
can be so delightfully satiated from the well-filled lunch baskets;
and while the children are thus playing together what a
wonderful opportunity for the mothers to engage in an exchange
of helpful ideas. Each mother has her own way, which
is "the best way" to make this cake or that salad; or has
met this particular difficulty in child training in a carefully
thought out way; a neighborhood women's club can thus be
held out in the open, while the children are having the time of
their lives in the frolic of the picnic.</p>

<h4>"MOVIES"</h4>

<p>The movie is an institution that has come to stay, and today
mothers everywhere are perhaps discussing this particular institution
more than any other. The movie affords a wonderful
opportunity to see the sights and scenes of other lands, of feeding
the imagination of the child on travel pictures and nature
pictures. It is a most deplorable fact, however, that this wonderful
institution which is fraught with so many opportunities
to educate and enlighten the mind of the growing child has
carefully to be censored. Women's clubs have done much to
purify the movies for the school-age child; many theaters are
now showing on certain days a special afternoon movie for the
children; and while many of these movies have great possibilities
for good, we most earnestly urge that the school child see
the movie that he is to see before dinner, and not have his mind
excited and his nervous system "thrilled" just before going to
bed. Someone asked me several years ago, "Are you going
to let your little fellow go to movies?" I instantly answered,
"No, but I shall take him." If the mother or the father sits
by the side of a growing child and carefully, thoughtfully, and,
yes, prayerfully, points out the good and explains the evil, then
even the questionable movies will prove the means of bringing
father and son and mother and daughter, into closer companionship.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_396" id="Page_396">396</a></span></p>

<p>Under no circumstances should children under twelve years
of age be taken to long lectures, entertainments, or concerts,
which will keep them out until eleven.</p>

<h4>VACATIONS</h4>

<p>Let the vacation be well planned. This is the opportunity
"de luxe" for the child to earn a few pennies to enlarge his
bank account. Allow him a truck garden, guinea pigs, chickens,
anything remunerative, which will enable him to become one
of the world's workers and one of the world's savers. Let
him start a bank account when he is six, and watch him as he
puts the dime in the bank, instead of taking it to the ice-cream-soda
cashier.</p>

<p>Some time during the vacation, if possible, mother and father
should accompany the little folks to the camp, to the beach&mdash;somewhere,
anywhere&mdash;to get back to nature and live like
Indians for a short time. Each member of the family will come
back rested, happier, and more ready for the next year's work.</p>

<p>In the summer time learn to eat on the porch&mdash;it is great
sport for the children. Many meals can be served on porches
that are so often served in hot, stuffy rooms.</p>

<p>The "home" does not consist in the furniture, the rooms,
the bric-a-brac, or the curtains. The home is the mother and
the father and the children and the spirit of good fellowship
which should possess them. Make the companions of the little
folks very welcome, letting them learn the early use and abuse
of the different articles of furniture in the house. It is all right
to play tent with the beautiful couch cover; it is all right at
certain times to dress up in father's best clothes and mother's
beautiful gown, but while they are thus having a good time let
them learn that all these things are to be used and not abused.</p>

<h4>ADOLESCENT DAYS</h4>

<p>The homely boy or the homely girl usually grows up free
from the flattery and undue attention which are sure to be
heaped upon the good-looking boy and the popular girl. Way
back in the early days of five or six, and all the way up to the
ages of twelve to twenty, children should be taught that it is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_397" id="Page_397">397</a></span>
altogether natural and correct to do things well and to look
well; parents should stop, and cause their acquaintances to stop,
"making over" the boy or the girl just because they have done
something well, or have beautiful curls, or because their eyes
are a magnificent brown, etc. If a girl should be especially
endowed with a charming complexion, a wonderful chin, and
if she does possess a beautiful nose or neck, let her early realize
that she has been made the custodian of goodly features and
that she must give an account for this particular blessing, and
under no circumstances must she become self-conscious about
it. Ofttimes a good frown to an unwise friend is all that is
necessary to stop this "lip service" flattery.</p>

<p>The "chewing-gum girl" is just a thoughtless girl, that is
all; sit her in front of a mirror and compel her to chew gum
for one-half hour and watch herself do it, and it will often
suffice to cure her. Young ladies should be taught that chewing
gum should be done in the bedroom, but never in the living-room
or on the streets. It is not only a disgusting habit, but
it often creates an occasion for criticism as to the quality of
one's home training.</p>

<h4>ICE-CREAM PARLORS</h4>

<p>The mother who cares will not allow her lovely daughters
nightly, or even semi-weekly, to frequent the ice-cream parlors
and secluded soda fountains. She had far better arrange
group dinners and group receptions in her own parlor; with
ice cream served in her own dishes and eaten with spoons that
she has supervised the washing of.</p>

<p>Young women and young men in their late teens crave companionship,
and they should have it; but let it be under wise
chaperonage at home or in public rooms, and not in the solitude
of a lonely bench in the public park, or the seclusion of an out-of-the-way,
ice-cream parlor. This "running the streets"
which is so freely indulged in by the adolescent youth in the
early teens need not occur, if wise provision is made for the
assembly of small groups in the home.</p>

<p>Some elders think it pleasing and cute for young men and
young women&mdash;fourteen to sixteen, or even seventeen&mdash;to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_398" id="Page_398">398</a></span>
wrestle and roll around on the floor like two huge kittens; but
it is unwise and indiscreet and should be discouraged.</p>

<h4>DANCING</h4>

<p>We hesitate to speak of dancing for we realize it is a very
popular indoor recreation of today, but we most earnestly urge
that if dancing must be done, it be done under proper chaperonage,
and if young people must meet in public dance
halls let them be municipal dance halls, where motherly matrons
are in charge. Many of the social dances which bring the participants
into such close physical contact are to be discouraged
and stricken off the list; and while dancing is a splendid form
of exercise&mdash;let us add that it is also sometimes a dangerous
one.</p>

<h4>QUESTIONABLE PLAY</h4>

<p>After the boys and girls graduate from grammar school they
may come into contact with such agencies as secret societies&mdash;which
nine times out of ten are questionable&mdash;and while we
realize that there is a contention both for and against these
organizations, we may dismiss the subject here by simply adding
that we have known little special good to come out of these
societies.</p>

<p>While it may not be any more wrong to hit a ball from the
end of a stick&mdash;as in billiards&mdash;than it is to hit it from a
mallet in croquet; or from a stretched tendon, as in tennis; or
from a bat, as in baseball&mdash;we do not feel that we have to
argue the point, when we remind the reader that billiards and
pool, especially in the public parlors, do assemble questionable
companions, who use questionable language; while these games
are often accompanied by betting, which is always to be deplored.
And so with card playing, we see no greater harm in
playing a game of euchre, than a game of authors, as far as the
cards are concerned, but your boy and girl, as well as mine, as
a rule, have cleaner and purer minds at the home game of
authors than is probable in a game of cards in a public place.</p>

<p>In closing this chapter we have to announce a group of
wholesome recreations which may be entered into by our lovely<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_399" id="Page_399">399</a></span>
young people&mdash;the man and the woman of tomorrow&mdash;whom
we one and all wish to keep clean and good and pure; all the
while helping them to develop the sense of humor and the element
of play. Such recreations are tennis, golf, croquet, roque,
boating, sledding, skiing, bicycling, motoring, horseback riding,
and a host of others too numerous to mention. Let us not forget
that ofttimes pursuits such as garden-making and helping
the parent in the office or in the home, may be made a great
source of enjoyment to the adolescent youth, if they are allowed
to earn a small amount of money each week, which they may
deposit in the bank.</p>

<p>We close this chapter "Play and Recreation" with the wish
that all, old and young, would develop a greater sense of humor,
a greater love for play and recreation, which will increase the
health of both mind and body and prevent many nervous disorders
such as neurasthenia.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXXIX</h2>
<h2>THE PUNY CHILD</h2>
</div>

<p>In every neighborhood there is to be found the delicate child,
and everywhere anxious mothers are putting forth every
effort to improve the condition of their puny boys and girls. In
carefully looking over the puny child, we see an underweight
little creature with pale skin, and as he comes to the table
everybody notes that he refuses more or less food.</p>

<h4>DIET AND HYGIENE</h4>

<p>As we give the child a closer examination we find that certain
lymph glands are enlarged, possibly adenoids are present
in the post-nasal pharnyx, and, in many instances, there are
badly diseased tonsils. Usually the puny child is constipated,
hands and feet are cold, and he jumps and starts at any unusual
noise, thus showing a tendency to nervousness. One of the
first things necessary is to take this little one to a good specialist
and if necessary have the adenoids and tonsils removed.
This having been done, the diet should be carefully looked into.
There should be served him for breakfast a generous bowl of
dextrinized grains with a good portion of diluted cream, a
glass of rich milk, a baked potato, and fruit. For lunch at
twelve o'clock he should be given a glass of malted milk with
egg, or eggnog, six or eight dates or three or four figs, a handful
of pecan kernels, and perhaps a lettuce sandwich. For dinner
at half past five, another nourishing meal of baked potatoes,
a protein dish of either cheese and macaroni or eggs or meat,
a generous fruit salad, a glass of rich milk, and bread and butter,
should be enjoyed.</p>

<p>There is no class of little folks who eat between meals more
often than do these delicate children, for mothers painstakingly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_401" id="Page_401">401</a></span>
endeavor to feed these children all they can possibly take; so
one mother thoughtlessly went about it something like this: the
half past seven breakfast having been only touched&mdash;nibbled
at&mdash;with the ten o'clock hour came this request: "Mother,
I am so hungry, I want something to eat." Eagerly the mother
prepared either a meat sandwich or a jelly sandwich and possibly
a glass of milk.</p>

<p>When it was time for the twelve o'clock dinner hour, or
lunch hour, again the well-filled plate was refused, the appetite
having been satisfied at ten o'clock. Having taken very little
nourishment at noon, by half past two the plaintive plea again
came to the mother ears: "May I have a piece?" and again
the well-meaning mother gave him the desire of his heart. So
the day passed, the dinner making the fifth time food was
taken into the stomach, and in all probability there was eaten
a cookie in between. The reader can readily see that the digestion
was consequently very much disturbed, fermentation occurred,
decomposition of food took place in the digestive tract,
with its result&mdash;constipation.</p>

<h4>IMPROVING THE APPETITE</h4>

<p>Not a morsel should pass the lips of any child, and particularly
our delicate child, between meals. Let him come to the
table at half past seven or eight o'clock, and if he does not
want to eat tell him frankly that that is all he is to receive until
twelve&mdash;and stick to it. Nothing more than water or fruit
juices should be taken between meals.</p>

<p>It may be necessary to create an appetite for the three meals
we have just described, and as we now take up the outdoor
hygiene we would not forget that some simple treatment should
be instituted each day in a well-heated bathroom or bedroom.
Roller skating or ice skating, hoop-rolling, rope-skipping, and
Irish mail, or a coaster, all furnish splendid exercise for the
delicate child. Under no circumstances should he be allowed to
remain all the time in the house; and so pleasing recreations
must be provided for him out of doors. The sand pile should
not be forgotten, flower-bed making, raking the lawn, a polished
coasting board fastened in a slanting position to an upright<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_402" id="Page_402">402</a></span>
which can be mounted by means of a ladder, create splendid
outdoor sports for these children.</p>

<h4>THE DAILY PROGRAM</h4>

<p>Take the child into a warm bathroom each morning and let
him stand in six inches of well-warmed water. With a rough
mitten made out of either mohair, crash, or turkish towel, the
entire body should now be rubbed until it is pink. This procedure
is known as a dry-friction rub. Do not stop until the
skin is pink, particularly the arms and legs, for the back and
chest usually get pink quickly. Then with simply a cold dash
of water to the feet, dry them well and allow him to dress.
Twenty minutes before the meal hour, let him get out of the
house and roller skate around the square as many times as he
can in twenty minutes, or let him race and have a royal good
time in the fresh morning air and then after this forced oxygen
intake let him come in to breakfast.</p>

<p>And now for school, and as we say "school," we regret that
there are not more "open-air schools." Some day the American
people, more particularly the American mothers, will
awaken to the fact that we need more schools with simply window
space rather than so many closed glass windows. Some
day we will send our children with sweaters, leggings, stockinet
caps, mittens, even in the cool days of spring and fall, to
"open-air schools," and in the cool fresh air they will think better
and work faster and make wonderful progress in both
studies and appetites.</p>

<p>The particularly delicate child, under treatment, will not
spend the whole day in school. In all probability the forenoon
session only will be attended, after which the half-past-twelve
or one-o'clock meal that has been previously described will be
given him. Now if the appetite is variable, arrange a little
surprise for him by serving this meal on the porch or in the
living-room by the open grate, or out under the trees. In all
probability such a meal will be taken eagerly, particularly if
the mother will read a pretty story. Now the afternoon is to
be spent in doing a number of different things. We would
like a pleasant walk, a visit to the park, hoop-rolling, roller<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_403" id="Page_403">403</a></span>-skating,
rope-skipping, ice-skating, outdoor sliding, anything
that will take our little fellow out of doors to increase his
oxygen intake until possibly the half-past-three hour is reached,
when he should come into the house and lie down and prepare
for the treatment for that particular day.</p>

<h4>TREATMENT SUGGESTIONS</h4>

<p>Twice a week he should be given a salt glow (described in
the <a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a>). Twice a week he should be given a thorough
soap shampoo (also described in the <a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a>). After each of
these baths a special rub should be administered to the spine,
and as there is so often spinal curvature in these children, certain
stretching movements of the spine are valuable, together
with hot fomentations (see <a href="#APPENDIX">Appendix</a>) over the spinal centers.
These are wonderful stimulants to the delicate child and should
precede the salt glow twice a week. Every afternoon a hot-and-cold
foot bath may be given to create a better circulation.
The feet are put in hot water from three to five minutes (as
hot as can be borne), and then they are quickly plunged into
the coldest water obtainable for three seconds, then back into
the hot water, and vice versa, until three changes have been
made, always finishing the treatment with the cold dip. On the
three remaining days of the week at half past three, the child
will simply relax in the hammock or on the porch couch while
the mother aids in the relaxation by a pleasant story. We
would suggest that on Monday the salt glow be administered;
Tuesday a rest is taken; Wednesday the soap shampoo is to be
administered; Thursday another rest; Friday a salt glow; Saturday
another rest, and Sunday the shampoo, etc.</p>

<p>Before going to bed at night, with the mother's hands well
oiled with either olive or sweet oil, the circulation is again
stimulated by the heavy friction rub.</p>

<p>Constipation is taken care of along the same lines as mentioned
elsewhere in this book.</p>

<p>It is surprising to see how often these delicate children are
infested by worms, and while a great deal of dependence cannot
be put in that single symptom "grinding the teeth at night,"
or "pallor around the mouth," yet we do believe that many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_404" id="Page_404">404</a></span>
a delicate child continues to suffer from worms many years.
It is a very simple procedure to obtain a specimen of the stools.
A cathartic should be given and after usual free-bowel movement,
the second time the child desires to go to stool this should
be saved and taken to the laboratory for a careful search for
worm eggs which are usually in evidence if worms infest the
child. The treatment for worms is described elsewhere in this
work.</p>

<p>We have seen scores of young people between the ages of
eight and eleven who, before treatment, were pale, listless,
under weight, irritable and cross, after three months of such
treatment as has been outlined gain six to ten pounds and look
as ruddy as their healthiest neighborhood friends. It is perfectly
marvelous to notice how a child will put on from six
to eight pounds in a short period, at the same time overcoming
his irritableness and fretfulness. I am more and more inclined
to believe that most bad children are sick children&mdash;are
undernourished children&mdash;and it behooves us American
mothers and fathers to give proper attention to this undernourished
child, call a halt, and devote three months to giving
him the help that he needs. He did not ask to come into this
world; and it is "up to us" to give this child what he deserves&mdash;for
every child in this world has a right to be well born, to
be well fed, and to be well reared.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XL</h2>
<h2>TEACHING TRUTH</h2>
</div>

<p>We confidently believe that most of the sex immorality
seen in young people is more or less the result of
ignorance and curiosity; therefore we most earnestly desire in
this chapter to portray so interestingly the beautiful story of
life as seen in the vegetable and animal world, that our mother-readers
will be seized with the great desire wisely to convey to
the young child's mind this sublime and beautiful story. The
questions most naturally arising in the mind of the reader at
this time are: When shall we begin to tell this story? How
shall we tell it? Where shall we begin? Where shall we
stop? Realizing full well that the subject is usually handled
prematurely and with unpreparedness, we will attempt in this
chapter to discuss it with courage and candor, believing that
there is a right way, a right time, and a right place to impart
this information.</p>

<h4>A LESSON FROM NATURE</h4>

<p>When the little folks are about three or four years of age,
when confidence and trust are at their height, they often come
to us begging for a "story;" and this is the golden opportunity
for the parent or caretaker to tell them the story of Mr. and
Mrs. Corn, and all their little babies; or Mr. and Mrs. Morning
Glory and their little folks. There are a score of other equally
interesting and instructive botanical stories which are just as
beautiful in their sublimity, and fairy-like in their personality.
The little children's eyes grow big with wonder as you tell the
story of a whole township of families by the name of Corn (See
<a href="#illus-019">Fig. 17</a>), who have their residences out in the wide country
fields.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_406" id="Page_406">406</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 494px; padding-top: 1em; padding-bottom: 1em">
<a name="illus-019" id="illus-019"></a>
<img src="images/fig1718.png" alt="Fig. 17 Fig.18" title="" width="494" height="689" />
<span class="caption">Fig. 17&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fig.18</span>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_407" id="Page_407">407</a></span></p>

<p>We will first introduce the child to Mr. Corn, the tassel, waving
proudly and majestically in the breezes, and seeming to
say: "I am master of all I survey." The little fellow is filled
with wonderment as he learns how the clouds give up their
drops of water to quench his thirst and how the sun smiles
upon him to yellow his beard; and how the wonderful all-important
<i>pollen</i> is developed and ripened.</p>

<p>Often the child eagerly asks, "And where, mamma, is Mrs.
Corn?" and to that interested upturned face we relate the pleasing
story of the beautiful silken tresses of Mother Corn. Early
in her life she is a beautiful shade of green, and as she thus
gracefully hangs out from the ear of corn, day by day the
smiles of sunshine turn this mother corn to brown, and then to
a still darker shade.</p>

<p>"And where, mamma, are the babies?" the child next inquires;
and, as we take the ear of corn, removing the outer
clothing&mdash;the husks&mdash;we find the underclothing, a much
lighter shade of green, and here now we are in close contact
with the babies themselves&mdash;the kernels&mdash;and to each little
kernel or baby corn we find mamma closely clinging. Here is
a beautiful opportunity to teach mother-love and mother watchfulness,
as also the opportunity to draw lessons from the baby
kernels sitting there in even rows, with their faces clean,
silently contented&mdash;just doing their duty. The stories that
may be told are limitless, and possibly as interesting as are the
myths and fairy-tales, yet all the while as true as truth itself,
with no fakery, no legends&mdash;just simple truth.</p>

<h4>THE ALL IMPORTANT POLLEN</h4>

<p>Now on a second trip into the cornfield, another story may be
told of the important work of the pollen. This "father part"
of the plant falls upon the silken tresses of the "mother part,"
by which the pollen is carried down to the sleeping corn-baby
seeds&mdash;the kernels. And when the "corn dust" does reach
the sleeping seeds a great change begins to take place. This
change is known to the adult as "impregnation;" to the little
child it may be presented as "an awakening" of the sleeping
seeds, so that they begin to grow, to develop, to expand and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_408" id="Page_408">408</a></span>
push out, until we have the full-grown seeds seen in the delicious
and juicy roasting ear.</p>

<p>Sometimes, in the case of the larger plants and trees, Father
Tree may be miles and miles away from Mother Tree and so
this all important pollen must be carried by the wind or by the
bees, and as it blows against the mother part of the plant-flower
she catches it and pushes it downward to the seed babies. The
wind scatters the pollen of the oak tree, the hazlenut, the walnut,
the birch, the willow and many others; for, without the
good kind wind or the bees, the pollen would never find its way
to many a mother flower, and the "fertilization" of the seed
could not take place.</p>

<h4>THE MORNING GLORY FAMILY</h4>

<p>Perhaps the story of life can be told as beautifully from the
morning-glory as from any other flower. Here the beautiful
flower cup is the home of Father and Mother Morning-Glory
and all their little babies. (See <a href="#illus-019">Fig. 18</a>).</p>

<p>As we carefully take away their little home, the flower
cup, we have left a little green cup, and coming up from
the center you will see five little stems, every one of them
wearing a hat of powder or pollen and this&mdash;if you
please&mdash;is Papa Morning-Glory. Look closely and you will
see coming up from the center of these five stems (stamens)
one central stalk without a hat, Mother Morning-Glory, known
in botany as the "pistil"; and as you follow down this pistil
you will find an enlarged part at the base, which is known as
the cradle-nest&mdash;the home of the seed babies.</p>

<p>Little was known about this wonderful fertilization of the
seeds by the pollen two hundred years ago, and a whole century
passed before the secret of the blossom and the bees was
discovered; and even then it was not fully realized how great
was the work of the bees in cross-fertilization. Nor was it
understood that the beautiful blossom of the flower, with its
sweet nectar, was an exceedingly important factor in attracting
the bees. Another century passed before Darwin gave to the
world the story of the great work performed by the bees in
cross-fertilization&mdash;in carrying the pollen from flower to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_409" id="Page_409">409</a></span>
flower, for it is now a well-known fact that all of the blossoms
visited by the bees produce better fruit and better flowers.</p>

<p>In the flower where the father and mother part matures at
the same time, self-fertilization is the rule. Cross-fertilization
occurs in instances where either the father part or mother
part ripen at different times, in these cases the pollen is carried
from plant to plant by the wind or by the nectar-seeking bees.
These busy bees, with their fluffy little feet and fuzzy coats,
become completely covered with this all-important flower dust,
and in seeking nectar from other flowers they leave the "awakening
dust" behind, and thus cross-fertilization takes place;
new types of babies are produced, new generations of fruits
and flowers.</p>

<h4>HOW MOTHER NATURE WORKS</h4>

<p>Dr. Chadwick, in her <i>Blossom Babies</i>, gives us a beautiful
recital concerning the fertilization of plants, which provides
an endless number of interesting stories. The water plants
are very interesting in that the pollen is just light enough to
float on the exact level of the mother part of the flower, otherwise
fertilization could never take place, and there would be
no more lovely lilies. Long throated blossoms are fertilized
by their attraction for certain moths or humming birds who
have long tongues. Mother Nature is exceedingly careful to
reproduce her children, and in every conceivable way she
sees to it that her plant-seeds are fertilized and distributed.
We are all familiar with the dandelion and the thistle and a
host of others which fly through the air with actual plumes,
some seeds fly with wings, such as the maple; other seeds travel
by clinging or sticking, such as the cockle burr; still others
float and shoot; while we all know about a lot of seeds that
are good to eat, such as the nuts and fruits, as well as many
of the grains, such as corn, etc.</p>

<p>An incubator about hatching time is a wonderful object
lesson in teaching the story of life. Take the children to visit
one and let them actually see the live baby chicks coming forth
from the seed-shells. Other wonderful lessons may be drawn
from the mother horse or the mother cow; and it is impossi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_410" id="Page_410">410</a></span>ble
to portray the close companionship, the sublime trust and
confidence, which exists between the mother and the child who
have been bound together by these ties and sentiments of truthfulness,
trustfulness, and frankness.</p>

<h4>THE SALMON FAMILY</h4>

<p>The little fellow is daily learning that everything that
grows comes from a seed, even the salmon which was eaten at
lunch yesterday was the text for an impressive story about
Papa and Mamma Salmon. In the beautiful Columbia river
Mother Salmon is swimming about quietly seeking a shallow
place in the stream where she may deposit her cluster of baby
seeds, which looks very much like a mass of tapioca pudding
as they gently sink to the bed of a shallow spot in the river.
There they lay "sound asleep" until Father Salmon, swimming
by, is attracted to the spot and, hesitating, talks something
like this to himself: "Why the idea, here are some helpless
fish-baby seeds, they can't grow and develop without me, here
they are sound asleep;" and, nestling over them, he contributes
the self-same and all important "something"&mdash;comparable to
the pollen of the plants&mdash;which wakes them up. In the case
of the fish the "awakening" substance is not in the form of a
powder as in the plant world; but is in the form of a semi-liquid
mass, much resembling the white of an egg. The little
seeds soon begin to tremble&mdash;begin to wake up&mdash;and then
begin to swell and grow and develop. In a few days what do
you suppose happens to these little bulging baby seeds? The
very same thing that happened to the chick seed&mdash;they burst
and out come hundreds of cute little fish minnows. In just
a few hours they are all swimming about in a most wonderful
fish-like manner.</p>

<h4>EARLY QUESTIONS</h4>

<p>Some day you will be surprised by your little child suddenly
asking you some such question as this: "Mother, where did
I come from?" while in the same frank manner you reply:
"Why from your mamma, of course; where do you think you
could have come from? Everything that grows comes from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_411" id="Page_411">411</a></span>
its mamma&mdash;oranges, apples, radishes, cabbages, cats, dogs,
and chickies&mdash;everything that grows has to have a mamma
and papa," and they are often satisfied with this answer for
a long time. No child should go to kindergarten without
knowing that he came from his mother, and this knowledge
should come to him from his own mother's lips. These are
different days than those in which our grandmothers lived.
The spirit of investigation and of inquiry is in the air. The
moving-picture show makes it necessary for children of nine
or ten to understand these things&mdash;to have a knowledge of
certain of the conventionalities of life. Twenty years ago this
may not have been so necessary&mdash;the youth of that day might
have waited several years longer for certain phases of his sex
instruction. It is highly important that this knowledge be obtained
from a wise and pure and sympathetic mind&mdash;from the
child's own parents.</p>

<p>One mother put her little girl's questions off week after
week, saying: "I will tell you when you get older, dear&mdash;no,
not now, dear; run away, you are not old enough to know
such things, you must forget about them." Thus the unprepared
mother sought to gain time in which to consult the doctor
or the library. Finally the day came when the mother
felt that she was sufficiently wise to answer the query, "Where
did I come from," and so with her heart in her throat she
approached her daughter, saying: "Come, Mary, mother is
going to tell you all about it. I am now ready to answer your
question." Imagine her surprise and astonishment when Mary
said: "Oh, you needn't mind, mother, Kate told me all about
it last week." Now the question in my mind is: how did
Kate tell her? How much unnecessary information did this
older and experienced Kate put into the pure mind of this innocent
little girl?</p>

<h4>ONE MOTHER'S AWAKENING</h4>

<p>One mother in a western state&mdash;a county superintendent of
schools&mdash;told us the following interesting story of her own
experience, which we think may be of help to some of our
mother readers.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_412" id="Page_412">412</a></span></p>

<p>One morning her seven-year old son rushed into the house
exclaiming: "Oh, mother, there is a new calf out in the
barn, and I know where it came from; I saw a wagon load of
calves come by here yesterday, and one of them must have
dropped off, for it is right out there in the barn with old Bess
this minute."</p>

<p>The mother was very busy with her papers and her reports,
and she let the incident pass with a smile, thinking it was
a very pretty little story. A week later the six-year old
brother came in saying: "Mother, I think there must have been
another wagon load of calves passed by, and one must have
been lost off, for old Nell is cleaning up a little calf out in
the barn for all she is worth," while the older brother piped up:
"Sure, it was another load of calves; that is just exactly the
way the other calf got here;" and the two little fellows went
off to school.</p>

<p>About a month later that county superintendent suddenly
became a much wiser mother than she was before, although
her heart was made to ache. Both boys came home from
school one day and the older one met her with something
like this: "I am mad! I've been lied to; all the fellows at
school say I have, and they are making sport of me, too," and
with a glare in his reddened eye he continued, "You know
that new calf did not come off that wagon; you know that
calf came from old Bess herself; all the fellows say so at
school, and they are making all kinds of fun of me, and I
don't want to go back. I'd like to run away from home."
The mother quietly drew the boy to her side and reminded him
that she had simply listened; that she had not opened her
mouth; that he came into the room and told about the incident
himself, but this did not satisfy him. He turned to her wounded
and crushed, saying: "Well, you let a fellow believe it, and
that's just as bad;" and this educated mother&mdash;this trusted
custodian of a county full of school children&mdash;beseeched me to
warn mothers everywhere to teach their children the truth,
and to never let a child go to school with a sex misunderstanding.
She told me that it took her six months to get that boy's
confidence back again.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_413" id="Page_413">413</a></span></p>

<h4>DON'T GET SHOCKED</h4>

<p>I believe that many mothers make the sad mistake of showing
the child that they are shocked by trivial sayings and trifling
experiences of their little people. If we could only get
it into our heads for once and for all that our children are
born into this world veritable little thieves and falsifiers, as
well as adventurers and explorers, we would then cease being
so shocked and outraged by their frank statements of what
they have heard or have done. Let the mother listen to all these
things with calmness, while she seeks to direct the child's mind
in pure and elevated channels&mdash;to help him upward by imparting
"precept upon precept; here a little and there a little."</p>

<p>Children will come in with stories that at first thought do
greatly shock the parent; but under no circumstances should
the boy or girl discover that the parent is shocked, for if he
does he will not likely come again with another such "shocking"
difficulty. One mother told me that her seven-year-old
boy, beginning third grade, came into her bedroom one morning
saying: "Mother, I am just busting to say something,"
and this mother very wisely said, "Well, say it; certainly I
don't want you to burst," and she told me that this boy whispered
to her three of the filthiest words that he could possibly
have heard on the streets. In relating this experience to me
she said: "Do you know, doctor, that I really did not know
what to think at first, but I remembered that you had taught
me never to be shocked, and so I looked up and asked: "Do
you feel better?" whereupon he breathed a big sigh and
exclaimed: "What a relief! I have just been busting to say
that to somebody." Mother, to whom would you rather he
would say these things? to you, or to some little girl out on
the street, or to some older boy? Think what trouble and
possible mischief were avoided by whispering into the sympathetic
ear of mother. This wise mother turned to that little
boy and said: "Son, that ear is always waiting for just such
things and whenever you feel like saying something&mdash;like
getting it off your mind&mdash;you just come to me;" and he
came repeatedly. One time he came in saying: "I don't
know whether you want me to play with Harold or not; he does<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_414" id="Page_414">414</a></span>
some of those things you told me about the other day." And
the mother thoughtfully and wisely looked up and said: "Did
he do it in front of his mother? Why of course he didn't.
Did he ask you to go into the bedroom or bathroom and lock
the door?" and the little fellow quickly answered: "Why
sure he did; how did you guess it?" and added "now I suppose
you are not going to let me play with him any more,"
and this wise mother, knowing that if she denied him this
privilege that it would quite likely be frequently sought, said:
"Why, certainly play with Harold in the open, but whenever
he suggests secrecy&mdash;" she did not have time to finish the
sentence, the boy said: "I am wise; whenever he gets to doing
that 'funny business' I'll skiddoo." The confidence between
that mother and son, to my mind, was wonderfully sublime&mdash;all
the while practical and helpful in his daily training.</p>

<h4>DON'T REPULSE THE CHILD</h4>

<p>A little older child sees the fowls, the dogs, or the cats,
"mating," and then, rushing into the house, inquires what it
is all about; and unless the mother is on her guard some older
member of the family may show surprise and thus thoughtlessly
convey to the child's mind that his question is improper
and entirely out of place. To the question, "What are they
doing, mamma?" quietly answer, "Just mating, dear, just as
the flowers mate; everything that lives or grows comes as the
result of mating."</p>

<p>Suppose that you were repulsed every time you approached
a dear friend, your husband, or some other member of the
family? Take, for instance, the matter of a caress or an
embrace&mdash;how would you react to repeated rebuff? And
so with the little child; he comes into this world full of confidence
and trust, full of wonder and curiosity; possessed with
the spirit of exploration and investigation&mdash;everywhere and
all the time he asks questions. Usually, his questions are
answered thoughtfully and without hesitancy, except along the
line of one thought&mdash;that of sex. Do not think for one
moment that he is satisfied by your evasive answers. You
have but to recall your own childhood experiences, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_415" id="Page_415">415</a></span>
remember that today the moving picture show and general
public sentiment has placed the age for such knowledge from
one to five years earlier in this generation than in the past.
I do not care what the child comes into your presence with,
be it the most shocking thing in this world, do not under any
circumstances let it disturb your mental poise, or raise your
ire or shock you; for if you do, then and there&mdash;at that
moment&mdash;occurs a break in the sublime confidence which the
child reposes in you.</p>

<h4>NECESSARY MORAL TRAINING</h4>

<p>While we are using the plant and animal world as object
lessons in teaching our children the facts of sex and the secrets
of life; while we face the commonplace sex matings of the animals
about us without cringing, without appearing to be
shocked when our children call attention to these things;
nevertheless, when the child is old enough to take cognizance
of these phenomena, he is old enough to begin to receive some
definite instruction from his parents regarding the moral phase
of these great biologic problems. We cannot safely and indefinitely
utilize the animal world as an object lesson in sex education,
without at the same time emphasizing the moral difference
between man and the beast.</p>

<p>Many parents treat these sex problems so lightly and endeavor
to act so naturally and unconcerned about these questions,
that the child comes to look upon the promiscuous sexual
relations of the animal world as something altogether natural;
and, unless proper moral and religious training is carried on
at this time, he stands in danger of coming to regard lightly
the moral standards of modern society.</p>

<p>At the same time of life that Mother Nature fully develops
the sex instincts&mdash;at adolescence&mdash;she also awakens the religious
emotions; the one being so necessary for the proper and
adequate control of the other. Let parents take a cue from old
Mother Nature, and at the same time the sex relations of animals
are freely discussed with the growing child, let the mother
or father wisely call attention to the fact that but very few
of the animals live family lives as do human beings. In this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_416" id="Page_416">416</a></span>
connection valuable use&mdash;by way of illustration&mdash;can be
made of the ostrich and some of the ape family who are loyal
and true to their chosen companions.</p>

<p>Moral and religious instruction must accompany sex-hygiene
teaching just as soon as you leave the realms of botany and
enter the sphere of zoology. We could here relate many a
tragic experience which our patients have passed through as
a result of volunteering too much sex knowledge and at the
same time neglecting this very necessary moral instruction.</p>

<h4>SANTA CLAUS AND THE STORK</h4>

<p>We must bear in mind that the child believes what we tell
him; he trusts us implicitly and we owe it to him to teach him
the truth in answer to his numerous questions. We must
keep his confidence. Take the matter of Christmas, for
instance. How many confidences have been broken over the
falsehood of Santa Claus and the chimney. Two little fellows
hesitated in their play in the back yard, and the following
conversation was heard: "You know that story about Santa
Claus is all a fake." "Sure it is, I know it isn't so, I saw my
father and mother filling the stockings. You know that stork
story is all a lie too, there's nothing to it, babies don't come that
way, and now I'm investigating this Jesus Christ story, I suppose
that's all a fake too." The fact of the matter is, that
while these children have discovered the truth of the first two
stories, for a long time they will query the third story, for to
them, that too is mysterious and fairy-like. They hadn't seen
Santa or the Stork and had only heard about Jesus.</p>

<h4>STORY OF THE HUMAN BABY</h4>

<p>The story of the human baby may be told to any child of
seven to ten years. Each mother will have to decide in her
own mind the right time to go into the details of the human
baby seed. The child should have had an opportunity to have
planted some seeds in the ground, to have visited an incubator,
or to have visited the farm and observed the family groups of
babies&mdash;the chicks, pigs, calves, etc.&mdash;with their mothers.</p>

<p>Let me see now how many different baby seeds do we know?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_417" id="Page_417">417</a></span>
Yes, we do know the radish seeds, many flower seeds, chicken
seeds, bird seeds, corn, potatoes, and many others, and we can
tell them all apart. The boy and girl baby seeds are too tiny
to be seen with the eye. They are so small that it takes about
two hundred of them in a row to make one inch. We can
only see these human baby seeds with the aid of a microscope.
It is such a precious seed that it cannot be intrusted to the
ground or to a tree nest for development. The great Wise
Father decided that a mamma would love and care for it better
than anything or anybody in all the world. So, just as
there is a cradle bed in the mamma flower, so there is in the
human mother's own warm body, tucked far away from the
cold rains and the hot sun, a little bed, for the boy and girl
baby seeds. Right near to this little seed bed Mother Nature
has prepared a little room, which holds the tiny "waked up"
seed for nearly a year as it slowly grows into a little baby girl
or baby boy.</p>

<h4>THE MATING STORY</h4>

<p>You remember the story of how Bob Robin found Jenny
Robin, don't you? You remember mamma told you how Bob
came up from the southland early in the spring and asked
Jenny in lovely bird song to come and be his very own wife?
How he promised her he would feed her on cherries, and currants
and the fattest of worms? And that she told Bob she
loved him and went to live with him, and how they built that
cute little nest to hold the eggs; and how Jenny Robin sat on
the nest until the little baby robins were all hatched out.</p>

<p>Well, one day papa found mamma. He met her and loved
her dearly and told her he wanted her to come and live with
him, and they built their home nest and were very happy
together, because they decided they would always love each
other more than any one else in the world. After mamma
and papa built their home and lived together, one day a wonderful
change came to one of the baby seeds and it awakened
and began to grow. Mother Nature whispered to it, and told
it how to find its way into this little room and there it clung
to the wall and grew for nearly a year. Papa brought mamma<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_418" id="Page_418">418</a></span>
nice things to eat, just as Bob Robin did Jenny. Papa did
everything he could to make mamma happy and comfortable.</p>

<p>For nearly five months this little seed just grew and did not
let anybody know it was there, until one day it began to tap
against the sides of the walls of this little room, and every
time it did mamma's heart just bounded with joy as she thought
of the precious seed growing to be a darling baby&mdash;and all
inside of her very own body. And one day, after nearly a
whole year had passed, the door to the room began to open, and,
very soon, a lovely baby found its way out of this special room
into the big, big world. Mother Nature then told this little
baby that it might still remain close to the mamma it had been
with so long, and so she taught it how to get its food every
day from mamma's breast. At this point the child usually
breaks out by saying, "Now, mamma, I know just why I love
you so much."</p>

<h4>UNFOLDING THE TRUTH</h4>

<p>I shall always remember with pleasure my own son, not quite
two-and-a-half years old, who sat at the table one day asking
numerous questions such as, "Mamma, what is that? Mamma,
where did that come from?" etc.</p>

<p>He picked up a navel orange, and pointing to the navel said,
"What is that?"</p>

<p>I frankly said to him, "Why, my dear, that is the baby
orange."</p>

<p>"Why, Mamma," he exclaimed, "do oranges come from
oranges?"</p>

<p>"Certainly, dear child; where else could they come from?"</p>

<p>"But," he says, "Mamma, do potatoes come from potatoes?"</p>

<p>"Why, honey," I said, "Orange babies come from orange
mammas, potato babies from potato mammas, grapes come
from grape mammas, little kitties from kitty mammas, and little
boys from their mammas."</p>

<p>We simply mixed all the babies up, just as you would mix
up a delicious fruit salad. We took from the mind all question
of mystery and surprise by quickly and honestly answering
his question. Thus, his first knowledge of his origin, if he is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_419" id="Page_419">419</a></span>
able to recall it, will ever be associated with oranges, grapes,
potatoes, kittens, etc.</p>

<p>We did not tell the whole story for some two or three years
later, but day by day we simply answered the questions as he
asked them.</p>

<p>One day, when he was about three, he burst into my bedroom,
saying, "Mamma, dear, I did come from you, didn't I?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, darling, from nobody else; just from your own
mamma and papa."</p>

<p>"Say, mamma, was my hand in your hand, my foot in your
foot, my head in your head?"</p>

<p>"No, dear," I replied, "You were all curled up as snug as
a little kitty is when it's asleep, and you slept for nearly a
year in a little room underneath mamma's heart."</p>

<p>It was a wonderful story. He threw his chubby arms about
my neck, his legs around my waist, and said: "You dear,
dear, mamma. I do love you and papa more, just awful
much."</p>

<h4>THE DOCTOR'S PART</h4>

<p>In my private sitting-room, where William and I have had
many conferences, there hangs my medical-class picture with
classmates and faculty. A member of my family was one day
answering the boy's queries as to who this one or that one
was, etc. Finally, on pointing to one particular face, the
answer came to his inquiry, "That's Dr. P. You wouldn't
be here if it wasn't for him." That evening the little fellow,
just past three years, came to me and asked, "Mamma, didn't
you say I came from you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, dear," I replied.</p>

<p>"Well, Auntie says I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for Dr. P.
What did the doctor have to do with it?"</p>

<p>"Why, simply this, dear. The door to the little room in
which you grew in mamma's body wouldn't open, and so kind
Dr. P. came and helped open the door."</p>

<p>"And let me out?" exclaimed the eager child. "Oh, I want
to go and see Dr. P. and thank him for helping me out!"</p>

<p>And this little fellow was neither shocked or surprised, any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_420" id="Page_420">420</a></span>
more than he was over finding out that orange babies came
from orange mammas.</p>

<p>In the same frank manner in which the simpler questions
are answered, strive to answer these important ones. If we
seek to evade, to postpone, to wrap in mystery these sex questions,
the little ones will not forget but will ponder and worry
over them, and seek to obtain certain knowledge from others
who oftentimes tell too much or too little, and such information
is usually mixed with much unnecessary matter which
may or may not be foreign to this particular subject. On the
other hand, if we frankly and honestly answer the question at
hand, curiosity is avoided and the child feels he understands
it all. The subject drops into the background of his mind&mdash;into
the marginal consciousness&mdash;with the countless other
facts he has accumulated. A sense of "knowledge possession"
is as comfortable to the child as it is to the adult.</p>

<h4>TRUSTING YOUR CHILD</h4>

<p>Often the question arises: "Will they tell to other children
this newly found knowledge?" If the wise mother makes them
feel they are a part of a "family," and reminds them that
such matters as the secrets about Santa Claus, the stork, and
the baby nest are only discussed in "family groups," they are
often seized with the normal pride which accompanies confidence,
and often keep secrets as well or even better than do
most adults.</p>

<p>One day a little man, three-and-a-half years old, was posing
for a photograph. The photographer said: "My little fellow,
you pose well. We've had such a good time together. Where
did they get such a lad as you?"</p>

<p>The mother's heart stood still. From her hiding place behind
a large curtain at the back of the studio, she listened, wondering
what would be his answer.</p>

<p>At first he hesitated, but after a moment's pause, said:
"Really, Mr. W. if you don't know I feel sorry for you, and
I'd really like to tell you, but I can't, it's a secret between me
and my mamma."</p>

<p>Children enjoy secrets. If possible, isolate a group of sub<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_421" id="Page_421">421</a></span>jects
that are not to be discussed with playmates, such as
Santa Claus facts, the stork story, and the baby story; often
the very isolation of one single fact stands out so big in the
child's mind that he is many times tempted to mention it, when,
if it were associated with a whole group of "family secrets"
he would seldom be led to talk about it. As we have said,
children can keep secrets much better than most adults; and
just suppose they <i>should</i> tell something&mdash;what harm? With
twenty-five false stories in the neighborhood, suppose one story
of truth should escape! No particular harm would result; but
I find they keep these secrets well.</p>

<p>Numerous questions will arise which should be met with open
frankness. No blush, no shame, should even suggest itself, for
we are dealing with a wonderful truth, so let us give out our
answers with clean hearts and pure minds. The Great Father
will bless us and surround our loved "flock" with a garment
of confidence in mother and father that will protect from
much of the evil which is in the world, and, eventually, our
little ones will grow into men and women whose very life of
purity will cast its influence into the social circle. Only
the company of the good and the true and the pure will be
sought when associating with the opposite sex; while, in the
end, better mothers and better fathers will be developed for
the work of the next generation.</p>

<h4>TEN POSSIBLE CAUSES OF SECRET VICE</h4>

<p>1. The attention of the little folks is often drawn to the
sexual organs by a sensation of itching which accompanies a
state of uncleanliness and filth. The genitals must be kept
scrupulously clean. Elsewhere in this book we paid our
respects to the rubber diaper, and we wish to reiterate at this
time that it is in all probability responsible for a great deal
of masturbation. The constant moisture and heat keeps the
genital organs in a state of congestion which is more or less
accompanied by itching sensations.</p>

<p>2. A long or tight foreskin in the male child favors the
accumulation of secretions which not only occasion itching sensations
but oftentimes are the cause of convulsions in early<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_422" id="Page_422">422</a></span>
infancy. In the case of the female, a tight foreskin over
the clitoris will retain secretions which also cause an itching
sensation.</p>

<p>3. Unscrupulous nurses sometimes actually teach these little
fellows to masturbate.</p>

<p>4. Lying in bed on the back with a full bladder, in the case
of the boy, often produces an erection of the penis, and this
is usually accompanied by a feeling of fullness which serves
to direct the mind to the genital organs.</p>

<p>5. Lying in bed alone with nothing to do but to investigate
often results in secret vice.</p>

<p>6. The unwise practice of allowing children to visit each
other over night and sleep together, is often productive of
mischief.</p>

<p>7. Constantly telling a little girl to keep her feet down, to
keep her dress down, makes her over conscious of sex and
otherwise causes the attention to be directed in unhealthy
channels.</p>

<p>8. Teasing a child unnecessarily about a little sweetheart
often produces an emotional reaction which is not altogether
desirable. These suggestions are especially bad in the older
children.</p>

<p>9. Unwise sex knowledge is usually productive of curious
investigations, which if not properly followed up, particularly
in those children who are temperamentally secretive, and who
do not fully confide in mother and father, often results in
moral misdemeanors.</p>

<p>10. Do not allow two young children habitually to isolate
themselves in their play. Direct their play away from the
attic, the basement, and other places remote from direct observation.</p>

<p>There is no use telling a child not to touch that part of his
body, particularly if it is a boy, for it is going to be absolutely
impossible for him to carry out such instructions. One mother
overheard her caretaker say, "Don't put your hand there, it
isn't nice." Immediately the wise mother called the caretaker
to her and reminded her that most children usually continue
to investigate even though they are told not to, and so the care<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_423" id="Page_423">423</a></span>taker
received this instruction: "When you see Harry putting
his hand to that particular part of his body, just gently draw
it away and divert his attention to something else, and when
he goes to sleep in his little bed teach him to lie on his side
and bring his little hands up under his chin or the side of his
face and remain near him telling him a beautiful story until
the eyes begin to get sleepy and pick him up immediately on
awaking in the morning."</p>

<p>This mother was quite unlike the mother who once came to
my office, saying: "Doctor Lena, I have done everything to
prevent my boy's handling himself, why every time he wakes
up at night I am always awake and I instantly say to him,
Charlie where are your hands? You see Doctor, I am doing
the best I know how." Very likely it is unnecessary to call
the attention of the reader to the fact that this mother was
doing more harm than good in constantly calling his attention
to the fact that he did have a sexual side to his nature.</p>

<h4>TRUTH VS. EXAGGERATION</h4>

<p>And just here let us add that while masturbation is an
unclean habit, an impure habit, and a thing altogether to be
shunned, we would not be honest to ourselves and to our
readers if we did not explain that under no circumstances
does it make foolish minds out of sound minds or insane
minds out of sane minds. If your boy or your girl is going to
grow up to be foolish or insane he had a through ticket for
the feebleminded institution or the insane asylum when he
was born into the world. The time when masturbation does
affect the mind of the child is when the mind awakens to the
fact that it is allowing an abnormal, unclean, or filthy habit
to dominate mind, soul, and body, and then, and usually not
until then, does this bad habit begin to cause mental depression
and a host of other symptoms that so often accompany masturbation.</p>

<p>In our worthy efforts to combat the evils of secret vice let
us not go to the other extreme and create such a condition of
mind in the youth of our generation as to lay the foundation
for sexual neurasthenia later on in life, as a result of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_424" id="Page_424">424</a></span>
the protracted worry, constant brooding, and conscientious condemnation,
which they so often experience following some
brief or trivial indulgence in early secret vice. Let us fight
this vice with the truth, and not resort to over-exaggerated
pictures which can only serve to blight the hopes and destroy
the courage of over-sensitive boys and girls after they have
grown up&mdash;as they look back on their lives and recall perhaps
a single misstep in their childhood. In this way we can hope
to do good today without mortgaging the child's happiness
and mental peace in years to come.</p>

<h4>BATHS USED TO REDUCE FEVER</h4>

<p>1. <i>The Sponge Bath.</i> The child, completely undressed but
loosely wrapped in a wool blanket, is placed on a table so that
the mother or a nurse may conveniently stand while administering
the bath. Close at hand have a number of soft linen towels and
a large bowl of tepid water which may or may not contain a
small amount of alcohol, witch-hazel, salt, or vinegar, according
to the doctor's directions. The upper portion of the body is
partially uncovered and the tepid water is applied with the hands
to the skin surface of one arm. The hands may be dipped in
water from one to four times, thus making repeated applications
of the water to the arm. These are followed by careful
drying&mdash;patting rather than rubbing. The other arm is now
taken, then the chest, then the back and last the legs.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Wet-Sheet Pack.</i> Two light-weight wool blankets are
folded to fit the child; they should extend eighteen inches below
the feet and should be wide enough to lap well in front. A sheet
just large enough to envelop the body is then wrung out of
cold water and spread out over the woolen blankets. The feverish
child is entirely disrobed and is placed on the wet sheet,
which is quickly wrapped about the body, over the chest, under
the arms, and between the legs&mdash;coming in contact with the
entire skin surface. The dry blankets are quickly brought
around and tucked snugly about the patient. This is a cooling
wet-sheet pack and will often so relieve the nervousness and
irritability of a feverish child that he will go to sleep in the
pack. In the very young child, under two years, it is important
to put some accessory warmth to the feet such as a warm-water
bottle&mdash;not hot. The effect of this pack is very quieting, and
is indicated when the temperature of the child reaches 103 F.
or more.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_428" id="Page_428">428</a></span></p>

<p>3. <i>The Graduated Bath.</i> This is usually administered in a
large bathtub and is beneficial in the fevers of the older children.
The temperature of the water should be one or two
degrees higher than the body temperature, for example&mdash;if
the child's temperature is 103 F. then the bath starts out with
a temperature of 104 or 105 F. The temperature is then gradually
lowered, about a degree every two minutes, until it reaches
92 or 90 F. A helper should support the head while the mother
or nurse briskly rubs the entire skin surface of the body. This
friction greatly facilitates the fever-reducing work of the bath
because it brings the blood to the surface where it is more
readily cooled by the bath. This bath should last ten or fifteen
minutes.</p>

<p>4. <i>The Hot Sponge Bath.</i> Often, in combating the high fever
of typhoid, the hot sponge bath is valuable. The hands are
dipped in water just as hot as can be borne and are applied to
the chilly, mottled skin which is so often seen in high fever. This
bath is administered just as is the tepid sponge bath. Evaporation
is allowed to take place to some extent by delaying the drying.
In this instance the child should be wrapped in a warm
wool blanket with only a portion of the body exposed at one
time.</p>

<p>5. <i>The Hot-Blanket Pack.</i> The hot-blanket pack is indicated
at the onset of many fevers such as in typhoid, grippe, pneumonia,
etc. Like the wet-sheet pack, the blankets are spread
upon the bed, abundant accessory heat is applied&mdash;such as a
half-dozen hot-water bottles. In the absence of these, glass
jars or hot ears of corn may be utilized. Hot bricks or hot
stove lids wrapped in paper are also serviceable. A blanket, in
size to suit the individual (an adult would use a full single
blanket, a child one-half of a single blanket), is wrung very
dry from boiling water. This may be done by the means of a
wash wringer, or two persons grasping the blanket by its gathered
ends may so twist it that it looks very much like an old-fashioned
twisted doughnut. The twist is now lowered into
boiling water, and as each pulls the twist wrings itself. This is
at once quickly spread out so as to let the child lay on the
center, and then the hot sides are brought in contact with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_429" id="Page_429">429</a></span>
skin, just as in the wet-sheet pack. The dry blankets are now
brought quickly and snugly about the child. Just outside the
second dry blanket the accessory heat is placed to the sides of
the trunk, the sides of the thighs, and one at the feet. A
wrapped stove lid or a hot-water bottle is placed over the
pelvis and one under the back. Cold cloths are put on the face
and around the neck, and these should be changed every three
minutes. This pack continues for fifteen or twenty minutes, at
the end of which time the accessory heat and the wet blanket
are removed and the patient is cooled off by a cold mitten friction,
a saline rub, a witch-hazel rub, or an alcohol rub; or the
patient may be placed in a tub of water, temperature 98 F.,
after which he should be carefully dried off.</p>

<p>6. <i>Sweating Baths.</i> Another bath which is effectual at the
onset of grippe or pneumonia is the sweating bath. The bowels
should have moved some time before the treatment. Have ready
a large bowl of ice water, two turkish towels, one sheet, and
four wool blankets. The bathtub is now filled with water at the
temperature of 100 F.; which is quickly raised up to 103 or
104 F. Ice-water towels are applied to the head, neck and heart.
The patient remains in this bath for about ten minutes, after
which he steps out and at once gets into the four hot, dry
blankets previously spread out on the bed. No time is lost, the
patient is quickly wrapped in the hot blankets and sweating
continues for twenty minutes. The covering is now loosened
and gradual cooling takes place. It is well to go to bed at once.</p>

<h4>TONIC BATHS</h4>

<p>1. <i>The Cold Mitten Friction.</i> The cold mitten friction is a
bath that is applicable to any condition where the child or adult
needs "toning up." It should always be preceded by heat to the
feet. The following articles are necessary. Four or five turkish
towels, a warm wool blanket, a hot-water bottle for the feet,
a bowl containing water, a generous piece of ice, and a rough
mitten without a thumb. The patient's clothes are removed
and he is wrapped in the warm blanket with heat to the feet.
One part of the body is taken at a time, first the arm, then the
other arm, then the chest, the abdomen, one leg, the second<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_430" id="Page_430">430</a></span>
leg, and last the back and the buttocks. A dry turkish towel is
placed under the part to be treated, and after the mittened hand
is dipped in ice-water, brisk short friction strokes are given to
the arm until it is pink. Several dippings of the mitten in ice-water
are necessary. One cannot be too active in administering
this bath. Slow, Delsarte movements are entirely out of place
at this time. Action&mdash;and quick action&mdash;is a necessity. No
part of the child's body is left until it is pink. It is an invigorating
tonic bath and is indicated in all conditions of low vitality,
functional inactivity, puniness, rickets, etc.</p>

<p>2. <i>The Salt Glow.</i> Fill the bathtub half full of warm water,
temperature 100 F. Slightly moisten one quart of coarse salt.
Stand the patient in the water, placing one foot on the side
of the tub while you rub the entire leg with the salt until it is
very pink. The other leg is treated in the same manner, as also
are the arms, abdomen, chest, and last, the back. By this time
he will be all aglow from head to foot. Rinse off the salt, and
give him a cold dash with the hands or a spray.</p>

<h4>THE NEUTRAL BATH</h4>

<p>Fill the tub with water at just 97 F., and remain in the bath
for twenty minutes or more, with the eyes covered, all the while
maintaining the temperature at 97 F. Dry gently with a sheet
to avoid exertion and exposure. Go at once to bed.</p>

<h4>FOMENTATIONS</h4>

<p>Hot fomentations often relieve suffering and are indicated
in such conditions as menstrual pain, abdominal cramps, colic,
backaches, etc. A good substitute for fomentations may be
given as follows: Fill a hot bag half-full of boiling water.
Over this place a wet flannel and two layers of dry flannel.
Apply for fifteen or twenty minutes over the skin area to be
treated, finishing up with a cold water or alcohol rub.</p>

<p>A very effectual way of applying moist heat to any portion of
the body is by the means of hot fomentations which are given
as follows:</p>

<p>One-fourth of a single woolen blanket (part cotton) is folded
and grasped at the ends and twisted like an old-fashioned dough<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_431" id="Page_431">431</a></span>nut.
The twist is then immersed in boiling water, the hands
still grasping the dry ends, and then by simply pulling out the
twist (widely separating the hands) the fomentation wrings
itself. This is placed steaming hot over the affected area which
has been first covered by a dry flannel. It is allowed to remain
on for three or four minutes, and then another hot one wrung
from the boiling water replaces the cool one. About four or
five such applications are made. The skin should be very red
at the close of this treatment. It is finished up with a quick,
cold application to the reddened skin area.</p>

<h4>THE SOAP SHAMPOO</h4>

<p>The undressed child is placed upon a low stool in the half-filled
bathtub at 100 F. with the feet in the warm water. A
good lather is applied all over the body with good friction by
the means of a shampoo brush and soap. He is then allowed
to sit down in the tub and splash about all he pleases, rinse the
soap off and allow him to have a good time generally. At the
close of the treatment the water is cooled down and the treatment
is finished with a brisk rub with the hands dipped in cold
water. The skin of the child should be pink at the close of the
treatment.</p>

<h4>MOIST ABDOMINAL BANDAGE</h4>

<p>The moist abdominal bandage is indicated in such conditions
as kidney inflammation which is so often seen in the second
week of scarlet fever; or in congestion of any of the internal
organs such as the liver, the stomach, intestines, etc., and is
applied as follows: Spread out the flannel bandage and over it
place the mackintosh. Wring dry the cotton strip from cold
water, and spread it over the mackintosh. Wrap all three layers,
the wet cloth next the skin, closely about the body, so as to prevent
the air from getting under it. Be sure that the feet are
warm while adjusting the bandage. In the morning remove
the bandage, and rub the skin briskly with a turkish towel
dipped in cold water, until the skin is pink and dry. The
cotton strip should be boiled every other day to avoid skin
eruptions.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_432" id="Page_432">432</a></span></p>

<h4>HEATING COMPRESS</h4>

<p>The heating compress is indicated in the following cases:
Sprained ankles, rheumatic joints, arthritis, sore throat, etc.
Directions: Wring two thicknesses of cheesecloth from cold
water, place over the painful part, and quickly cover with a
mackintosh and two thicknesses of woolen blanket bandage.
On removing in the morning, sponge with cold water or
alcohol.</p>

<h4>MUSTARD PASTE</h4>

<p>In the bronchitis of small children, particularly babies,
mustard pastes are to be preferred to the hot fomentations
which are used to such great advantage in children above ten.
The mustard paste is administered as follows: One part of
mustard and six parts of flour of the same measurements are
quickly stirred up with warm water to a paste thin enough
to spread well upon a piece of thin muslin, which is large
enough to cover twice the part to be treated. One-half of this
muslin is thus covered with the mustard and the dry piece of
cloth brought over. The edges are then folded in such a way
that the mustard will not run out. This is applied to the affected
part and allowed to remain for seven minutes on an infant,
nine minutes on a child, and ten or twelve minutes on an adult.
It is then removed and the moisture which is always seen
on the reddened skin surface is <i>not</i> wiped off but talcum powder
is sprinkled on thickly to absorb it. If this is done, a mustard
paste may be repeated every two hours if necessary and no
blistering or other harm will come to the skin.</p>

<h4>THE OIL-SILK JACKET</h4>

<p>The oil-silk jacket is used in bronchitis of babies and children.
It consists of three layers, the innermost layer of cheesecloth,
the middle layer of thin sheet wadding, and the outer
layer of oil-silk. This jacket should comfortably cover the
chest, front, and back; it has no sleeves, and is opened on the
shoulder and under the arm. It should always follow the
mustard paste in bronchitis. There should always be two<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_433" id="Page_433">433</a></span>
such cheesecloth and cotton jackets with the oil-silk covering
so they may be changed every twelve hours, thus allowing for
airing.</p>

<h4>STEAM INHALATIONS</h4>

<p>1. Steam inhalations are indicated in hoarseness and bronchitis.
They may be given in a number of ways. Perhaps
that most convenient for the young infant is the "bronchitis
tent." A sheet completely covers the crib, and, with the bed
amply protected with rubber sheeting or an extra blanket, steam
is allowed to enter under the sheet at the foot of the bed from
a funnel put into the nose of the teakettle. The steam should
continue for seven or eight minutes.</p>

<p>2. A large, heavy-paper funnel is put in the nose of the
teakettle which is boiling on the gas range. The mother holds
the child in her arms while she is enveloped with a sheet which
also includes the funnel. A helper carefully guards the flame.
The mother and baby may thus conveniently get the steam
with very little difficulty.</p>

<p>3. For the older child or adult, steam inhalations are to be
had from the ordinary croup kettle or from a twelve- or fourteen-inch
tin can which is filled two-thirds full of boiling
water. Over the top is loosely spread a cheesecloth upon which
a few drops of compound tincture of benzoin or eucalyptus are
sprinkled. The opened mouth is brought near the top of this
can and a towel is thrown over the head, can and all; the
patient thus being able satisfactorily to inhale the medicated
steam.</p>

<h4>POULTICES</h4>

<p>There are a number of mush poultices recommended for
different conditions&mdash;boils, felons, etc., but we find the aseptic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_435" id="Page_435">435</a></span>
heating compress to be as effectual as any of these dirty,
mush poultices and we suggest that our readers try the boracic-acid
poultice which is put on as follows: Over any infected
area or abrasion of the skin a thick padding of cotton moistened
by a saturated boracic-acid solution is placed. This is entirely
covered with wax paper or oiled-silk, and held in place by a
binder. It is sanitary and much to be preferred to any of the
mush poultices of bygone days.</p>

<h4>COUGH SYRUP</h4>

<p>A very useful cough syrup may be made as follows: Two
tablespoons of flaxseed are steeped on the stove until clear,
the jelly strained and flavored quite sour with lemon juice to
which is added rock candy for sweetening. This will often
effectively relieve the irritating coughs of childhood.</p>

skin disease which is so annoying in childhood as well as in adult
life. Prescription No. 1 is a clear fluid, and after the affected area
is thoroughly cleansed with resinol soap and rinsed in soft water, the
lotion is applied and allowed to dry. No. 2 is then patted on with
sterile cotton and often repeated to keep the <ins class="typo" title="Transcriber's note: original reads 'ecezmatous'">eczematous</ins> skin area

<p>CONSTIPATION</p>

<p>We submit the following home regime, which has proved
successful to many sufferers for the treatment of constipation.</p>

<p>1. On rising in the morning, remove the moist abdominal
bandage (mentioned above); drink two-thirds of a glass of
cold water; and spend fifteen to twenty minutes in the following
exercises, before dressing: Abdominal lifting with deep
breathing, auto-massage, leg raising, trunk twisting, trunk bending&mdash;forward
and to sides; lying down for the trunk raising,
and sitting for the trunk circumduction. Immediately following
these exercises, go to stool. Have feet raised from the
floor eight or ten inches, in order to simulate the squatting
position.</p>

<p>2. Breakfast should include bran or bran bread, and two or
three of the following foods: Apples with skins, grapefruit,
cranberries with skins (but little sugar), and figs. Immediately
after breakfast walk fifteen minutes in the open air, practicing
deep abdominal breathing. If the results at stool before breakfast
were not satisfactory, vaseline rectum and go to stool
again.</p>

<p>3. Lunch should consist of fruit only, while dinner should
include bran bread and two of the following foods: Spinach,
celery, carrots, parsnips, squash, or cabbage.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_437" id="Page_437">437</a></span></p>

<p>4. Before retiring, walk in the open air for fifteen minutes;
after undressing, exercise same as morning; and on retiring,
apply the moist abdominal bandage.</p>

<h4>OIL ENEMA</h4>

<p>The best way to administer an oil enema is by means of a
special enema can which holds one pint, to which is attached
a rubber tube. It is wise not to use an ordinary fountain
syringe as the oil spoils the rubber very quickly. This oil is
allowed to flow in slowly, under low pressure, and should be
retained over night. Any oil is acceptable, the cheaper sweet
oils will serve just as well as olive oil.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_442" id="Page_442">442</a></span></p>

<h4>HOT COLONIC FLUSHING</h4>

<p>The hot colonic flushing is particularly serviceable in combating
the sick headaches of migraine. They should be taken at
night just before retiring with the temperature of water as hot
as can be borne, from 108 to 110 F. Half of the water is
allowed to flow into the colon and is retained as long as possible.
This brings the heat in close contact with the sympathetic nervous
system whose headquarters is in the abdomen.</p>

<h4>ENEMAS</h4>

<p><i>Position for an Enema.</i> Lie on left side, knees brought up
against abdomen, with the left arm well underneath. This
will relax the abdominal muscles and allow the water to pass
upward more freely. The water should be allowed to flow until
it is felt low on the right side.</p>

<p><i>The one, two, three enema</i> is an injection that is used for the
relief of gas in the bowel. It consists of the following: One
part epsom salts, two parts glycerine, and three parts soap suds.
It is introduced by the aid of the colon tube and retained as
long as is possible.</p>

<p>Glycerine and soapy water, equal parts, may be introduced
into the bowel for temporary relief of a persistent constipation.</p>

<p>In instances when feeding by the mouth is impossible, <i>nutrient
enemas</i> should be given every three or four hours during the
day. The absorption does not take place in the large bowel as
readily as in the small intestines, so only a small amount of a
more highly concentrated solution is given at one time. A
child one year of age will be given one teaspoon, from one to
four years of age a teaspoon to a tablespoon is allowed, and
up to twelve years from one to eight tablespoons are given in
the nutrient enema. Peptonized meat preparations may be
employed in greater concentration than directed by the use of
the mouth. Peptonized milk containing an egg is often used.
The pepsin is added to the mixture only when warm, and is
injected at once.</p>

<h4>EMETICS</h4>

<p>1. A glass of warm water containing as much common table
salt as can be dissolved.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_444" id="Page_444">444</a></span></p>

<p>2. A teaspoon of mustard in a large glass of warm water.</p>

<p>3. A teaspoon of syrup of ipecac, repeated in fifteen minutes
if necessary.</p>

<p>Any one of these emetics is useful in instances where it is
desirable to empty the stomach at once.</p>

<h4>A CALORIE</h4>

<p>A calorie is the heat unit used in the estimation of the fuel
value of various foods. For instance, an ordinary slice of
homemade bread contains 100 calories. An ordinary fig contains
almost 100 calories. A large orange or an apple or a
glass of grape juice contains about 100 calories. There are
100 calories in three teaspoons of sugar or honey.</p>

<p>A complete food list with the estimation of calorie value of
foods is found in <i>The Science of Living</i>, page 370, while on
page 99 of the same book is a very helpful table showing the
amounts of various foods required to equal 100 calories. The
reader will find this exceedingly practical in estimating food
values for the household.</p>

<h4>ACIDIFYING AND ALKALINIZING FOODS</h4>

<p>Since we find that in all acute diseases the acidity of the
urine is greatly increased and in time of health it is less acid,
we submit two lists of foods which tend to acidify the urine or
to alkalinize the urine.</p>

<h4>CEREAL WATERS, ETC.</h4>

<p>It is often necessary to give the infant or the young child
cereal water to replace food in occasions of summer diarrhoea,
etc.</p>

<p>1. <i>Barley Water.</i><br />
One tablespoon of barley flour in one pint of water. Boil for
one-half hour, strain, and add sufficient boiled water to make
one pint.</p>

<p>2. <i>Flaxseed Tea.</i><br />
One tablespoon of flaxseed, one pint of boiling water; let
stand and keep warm for one hour; strain. Add juice of
lemon.</p>

<p>3. <i>Oatmeal Jelly.</i><br />
Four tablespoons of oatmeal, one pint of water; boil for
three hours in double boiler, adding water from time to time;
strain.</p>

<p>4. <i>Toast Water.</i><br />
One, two, or three slices of bread toasted dark brown, but
not burned. Put in one quart of boiling water, cover, and
strain when cold.</p>

<p>5. <i>Arrowroot Water.</i><br />
Wet two teaspoons of arrowroot with a little cold water, and
rub until smooth; then stir into one pint of boiling water and
boil for five minutes, stirring all the while.</p>

<p>6. <i>Oatmeal Water.</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_446" id="Page_446">446</a></span><br />
One tablespoon of oatmeal to one pint of boiling water, cover
and let simmer for one hour. Add water from time to time
as it evaporates; strain.</p>

<p>7. <i>Rice Water.</i><br />
One tablespoon of (washed) rice to one pint of water. Boil
three hours adding water from time to time.</p>

<h4>FRUIT JUICES</h4>

<p>Fruit juices are exceedingly beneficial all through life; particularly
is this true during early childhood when the little ones
are so likely to be constipated. Any of the fruit juices are good,
particularly the juices from oranges, raisins, prunes, apples,
pears, and cranberries. All these juices are better cooked than
raw with the exception of orange juice. All children should
have some fruit juice every day. For the very young baby
the juices are strained through a wire strainer and a clean
cheesecloth so as to remove every particle of solid matter, and
there should be added an equal amount of cold, boiled water
for the infant under ten months.</p>

<h4>LEMONADE AND EGGNOGS</h4>

<p>Lemonade, along with orangeade, grapefruitade and limeade
should be used for children above a year. They should be
well diluted and not too sweet.</p>

<p>Eggnogs are splendid for children who need to be helped
along with their diet. They may be given at the close of the
meal, never between meals&mdash;unless so prescribed by a physician.
The stomach should have ample time to complete the work of
digesting one meal before another partial meal is allowed to
enter it. Eggnogs consist of a well-beaten egg into which
there is placed a small amount of sugar, flavoring with either
nutmeg, vanilla, or cinnamon, and the glass filled up with rich
milk.</p>

<h4>MILKSHAKE</h4>

<p>Milkshake is a delightful drink. The white of an egg with
one or two teaspoons of sugar, two tablespoons of chopped ice,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_447" id="Page_447">447</a></span>
flavoring, and one ounce of cream are briskly shaken in a milk-shaker
for two minutes. Cold milk is added to fill the glass.</p>

<h4>MEAT AND MEAT JUICES</h4>

<p>Beef extracts are regarded by the medical profession as
purely stimulants. Beef juice is practically without food value.
In the preparation of beef juice the extractives and juices leave
the fibre. The food is in the fibre of the meat. The extractives
are purely of a stimulating order. We do not advocate the
giving of beef tea and beef juices to children; as a rule, we
think that cereal, gruels, strained soups, and milk are preferable.</p>

<p>The only reason for cooking meats is to destroy the parasites
such as tapeworm, trichina, etc., which are so often found in
the meat. The cooking of meat decreases its digestibility, as
raw meat is more easily digested than cooked meat, but we feel
it is necessary to advocate the cooking of meat in order to
kill the parasites.</p>

<h4>CODDLED EGG</h4>

<p>A fresh egg, shell on, is placed in boiling water which is
immediately after removed from the fire. The egg then
cooks slowly in the water, which gradually cools, for seven or
eight minutes, when the white should be about the consistency
of jelly. For a delicate digestion the white only should be
given, with salt; it can be easily separated from the yolk.
The above is the best form of egg for the young child. Later
on the eggs may be soft boiled or poached, or even soft
scrambled.</p>

<h4>SOUPS</h4>

<p>Two varieties of soups are given children. In the early
months of childhood, from six years to eighteen months, the
soups are usually strained, but after eighteen months, soups
may be thickened with flour and rich milk making a cream
soup of it. Most vegetables make good soups. The pulp from
such vegetables as asparagus, carrots, beans, peas, tomatoes,
and potatoes are made into cream soups by the addition of a
little flour, rich milk, butter, and a dash of salt.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_448" id="Page_448">448</a></span></p>

<h4>BREADS</h4>

<p>New breads should never be given to a child. Only bread
twenty-four hours old should ever be given to a child under
six years; it should be cut into slices and allowed to dry out;
and even then is better if slightly toasted. We publish a
recipe for bran bread and bran biscuits which are exceedingly
good for children and adults.</p>

<p><i>Recipe for Bran Bread.</i> Two eggs, beaten separately; three-fourths
of a cup of molasses, with one round teaspoon soda;
one cup of sour cream; one cup of sultana seedless raisins;
one cup of wheat flour, with one heaping teaspoon baking
powder; two cups of bran; stir well and bake one hour.</p>

<p><i>Bran Biscuits.</i> Mix one pint of bran, one-half pint of
flour, and one level teaspoon of baking soda. Mix one-half
pint of milk and four tablespoons of molasses. Add this to the
bran mixture and bake in gem pans.</p>
